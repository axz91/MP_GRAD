<h1>[Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 04/19/2022</h1>
<p>This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
<li>"How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Comment 1:</strong></p>
<p>The user is an Applied Physics undergrad. At their school, that basically means E&M 1 and Quantum 1 plus some STEM electives. They plan on taking at least a couple data/computer classes and are seeking advice on other classes that will be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Response 1:</strong></p>
<p>Another user suggests taking an A&P class before graduating as some programs require it. They mention that graduate level A&P might be required for CAMPEP accreditation in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Response 2:</strong></p>
<p>Another user agrees with the suggestion of taking A&P and regrets not doing it in undergrad. They mention that being a graduate level A&P might be required for CAMPEP accreditation in the coming years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comment 2:</strong></p>
<p>The user asks those who have completed or are currently completing residencies where they completed their residency, how many hours a week they worked on average, and what challenges they faced.</p>
<p><strong>Response 1:</strong></p>
<p>A user who hasn't started residency yet shares that during interviews, they would ask residents about their average weekly working hours. Most residents mentioned working 40-50 hours, with a few exceptions of 60+ hours during tough weeks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comment 3:</strong></p>
<p>The user asks how much more helpful/useful it is to be promoted to chief resident and if it significantly helps with salary or job position after residency.</p>
<p><strong>Response 1:</strong></p>
<p>A user suggests that being promoted to chief resident may look good on a resume if there are other residents in the program. However, they mention that in their residency, being the chief resident didn't receive much emphasis due to similar residencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comment 4:</strong></p>
<p>The user shares that they have been accepted to East Carolina University, University of Miami, and San Diego State University for medical physics. They are seeking advice on which program is more reputable and has a good reputation for grad students getting residency positions.</p>
<p><strong>Response 1:</strong></p>
<p>A user who is graduating from ECU offers to answer any questions or chat about their experience at ECU.</p>
<p><strong>Response 2:</strong></p>
<p>Another user asks if there is a specific reason the user doesn't plan on going to a program in Canada. They mention that admission in Canada can be competitive and there are limited options for residencies.</p>
<p><strong>Response 3:</strong></p>
<p>Another user suggests looking into the residency programs offered at each of the universities as it may provide an advantage when applying. They provide some information about the residency programs at ECU, Miami, and San Diego State.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comment 5:</strong></p>
<p>The user is looking for residencies that pay and accept MS students. They are open to moving and applying to many residency positions.</p>
<p><strong>Response 1:</strong></p>
<p>A user mentions that the majority of residencies pay their residents, except for SDSU. They also mention that many residencies accept applications from master's students.</p>
<p><strong>Response 2:</strong></p>
<p>Another user advises the user to gain clinical experience and suggests shadowing therapists and dosimetrists to understand the treatment process and make connections in the field.</p>
<p><strong>Response 3:</strong></p>
<p>Another user expresses their hope of finding a paid residency that accepts MS students and asks for advice on how to approach medical physicists, therapists, and dosimetrists for shadowing opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Response 4:</strong></p>
<p>A user shares their experience as an MS student who matched for residency and suggests applying to residencies that meet the user's criteria. They also provide advice on how to connect with medical physicists, therapists, and dosimetrists for shadowing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comment 6:</strong></p>
<p>The user asks about the type of clinical experience they will be getting at each university.</p>
<p><strong>Response 1:</strong></p>
<p>A user who will be attending UMiami shares that they will have a semester in radiation therapy clinical rotation at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Centre.</p>
<p><strong>Response 2:</strong></p>
<p>The user who will be attending ECU mentions that they did not mention where their clinical rotation will occur, but it will involve shadowing and participating in clinical work.</p>
<p><strong>Response 3:</strong></p>
<p>The user who will be attending SDSU mentions that they also don't mention where the clinical rotation will be done, but they offer radiation therapy lab rotation and diagnostic imaging lab rotation.</p>
<p><strong>Response 4:</strong></p>
<p>A user who has experience at UMiami suggests looking for a mentor at the Sylvester Cancer Center or Lennar and advises approaching medical physics residents and physicists to shadow them during QAs. They also recommend gaining clinical experience independently of the clinical rotation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comment 7:</strong></p>
<p>The user asks about the coursework in the program, the number of students in the program, and which track has the most students.</p>
<p><strong>Response 1:</strong></p>
<p>A user mentions that they don't know much about the full coursework as they only had to take 6 courses. They mention that the professors are helpful and prepare students for the ABR exam. They apologize for not knowing the number of students or the distribution among tracks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comment 8:</strong></p>
<p>The user asks how physicians view medical physicists and if they see them as glorified technicians or as professionals with equal standing.</p>
<p><strong>Response 1:</strong></p>
<p>A user shares that physicians view medical physicists as colleagues who help them achieve dosimetric goals and ensure patient safety. They mention that it is a two-way relationship, with physicians doing the medicine part and medical physicists doing the physics part.</p>
<p><strong>Response 2:</strong></p>
<p>Another user states that medical physicists are valued members of the healthcare team and suggests not getting worked up over those who don't view them that way.</p>
