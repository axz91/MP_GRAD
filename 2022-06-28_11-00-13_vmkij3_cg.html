<h1>[Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 06/28/2022</h1>
<p>This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
<li>"How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments:</h2>

<p><strong>Comment 1:</strong> The user is starting a medical physics MS next month and wants more information about graduate school and the courseload.</p>
<p><strong>Response 1:</strong> It depends on the university, but the best advice given by multiple people is that "you get what you put into it." Being proactive, exploring different research areas, seeking out collaborators, and being aware of important dates are all important. Getting to know the 2nd year and PhD students can provide insider information.</p>
<p><strong>Response 2:</strong> The course load is not that bad semester to semester. Some teachers expect students to read the section they plan on presenting before class. Time should be invested wisely, especially if the user is going to be a TA. Reflecting on areas for improvement from undergraduate studies can be helpful, as it may be a common interview question.</p>

<p><strong>Comment 2:</strong> The user is a nuclear medicine technologist certified in CT and is interested in pursuing a MS in MP program. They want to know if it is possible without having to go back to school and get a bachelor's degree in physics. They also ask if taking the physics GRE would help their case.</p>
<p><strong>Response 1:</strong> It is recommended to have math courses up to junior year (PDE's) and junior/senior level courses in QM, E&M, Stat. Mech, and Classical mechanics for better admission chances. Most medical physics programs are part of physics departments, so meeting the general graduate admission requirements for these physics departments is usually necessary before declaring an area of intent. It may not be necessary to do a third bachelor's degree, but taking the required courses is important. The best course of action would be to email the graduate medical physics program advisors/admissions officers and provide them with background information and transcripts to get the best advice.</p>
<p><strong>Response 2:</strong> The Physics GRE may not be necessary or helpful in this situation. Many schools are phasing it out, and without proper coursework in physics and math, preparing for it would be challenging. However, if the user manages to do well in it, it could potentially help. It is recommended to consider the time and effort required and weigh it against the potential payoff in the specific situation.</p>
<p><strong>Response 3:</strong> Most schools only ask for the General GRE, not the Physics GRE. However, some programs still require it, although it is being phased out.</p>
<p><strong>Response 4:</strong> The user expresses gratitude for the insight and advice provided.</p>
