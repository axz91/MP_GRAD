<h1>[Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 07/12/2022</h1>
<p><strong>Post Content:</strong> This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
<li>"How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>

<p>Hey, there’s actually a new thread for this next week, so you’ll probably want to ask there if you want a response</p>

<li>
<p>Comment 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The user is currently in their 2nd year of MSc in Medical Physics while working full time in Asia. They mention that in their country, a master's degree in a related field is required before applying for residency. They have observed that many residents have experience in fixing linac/CT MRI. They express concern about their current job not being related to radiation or imaging and ask for advice on how to prepare for residency without relevant experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Response 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The response states that therapeutic medical physicists are exposed to very little radiation on average. The user then asks how this compares to the average daily amount of radiation that a normal person receives.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comment 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The user asks if anyone has graduated with an MSC or PhD in medical physics and works in biomedical engineering. They inquire about the options available in the field of biomedical engineering and mention that medical physics is a unique field that may not fit neatly into engineering or science categories.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comment 3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The user asks if it is possible to study full time in the MS medical physics program while working part-time (10-20 hrs) on campus. They want to know if it is feasible to balance school and work, and how much time they would have for personal activities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Response 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The response suggests that it may be possible to study full time while working part-time, especially if the user is able to work on weekends. However, many programs recommend focusing solely on graduate work to ensure success. The response also advises using free time during the week for shadowing physicists or working in the clinic to gain practical experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Response 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The response shares personal experience of working as a TA/Instructor while in Grad School for Medical Physics. It acknowledges that balancing work and coursework can be challenging and may put the user behind, but ultimately, it worked out for the responder.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comment 4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The user asks about the possibility of taking the ABR part 1 exam in both January and August. They wonder if they can take the exam in August if they don't pass in January.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comment 5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The user expresses concern about not being able to push themselves to finish their PhD. They mention having completed additional coursework and having research experience, but still needing to write two more papers for their thesis. They also mention working part-time for a local hospital's dosimetry department and not getting a residency position after applying for the 2020 July starting date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Response 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The response suggests that there is no rush to finish the PhD and advises considering quitting if the user is unhappy. It also mentions the importance of having a solid alternative plan and acknowledges the complexity of applying to residencies while still in an academic status.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Response 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The response shares the mentor's advice of considering the user's accomplishments and the age they will be regardless of whether they finish their PhD. It mentions personal experience of finishing residency at almost 30 and finding it worth it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Response 3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The response reassures the user that they are not alone in feeling like they are spending too long on their PhD. It suggests seeking support from a professor who can provide perspective and help create an action plan. The response emphasizes being proud of the progress made so far.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comment 6:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The user is a 2nd year PhD student in a BME/Med Phys program doing research in fMRI methods and cognitive neuroscience. They express curiosity about when others started gaining clinical knowledge and experiences. They wonder how much clinical knowledge they should aim to have before residency and how much focus should be on research versus securing clinical shadowing experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Response 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The response states that the majority of clinical knowledge and experience will come from the residency program. While clinical exposure during grad school is beneficial, the focus should be on research and learning the fundamentals of medical physics.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comment 7:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The user asks if it is possible to move and work in Europe after completing grad school in the US. They mention having an EU passport but are unsure about how certifications would work in this scenario.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Response 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The response explains that the openness to foreign qualifications varies between countries. While a PhD is generally recognized, additional training may be required. The response also mentions that a part 1 ABR pass may not have much impact.</p>
