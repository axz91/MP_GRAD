Post Title: Diagnostic medical physics resident opening
Post Content: The Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, SC, is starting up a new CAMPEP accredited [diagnostic medical physics residency program](https://medicine.musc.edu/departments/radiology/education-programs/non-acgme-residency-program/medical-physics-residency-program) (page still needs a bit of updating...our program received initial CAMPEP accreditation last month) and is looking for a resident to begin July 1 or some time after.

This is a brand new program that we've been working hard to kick off for several years now.  In addition to the main MUSC campus in downtown Charleston, there are several large and small clinical sites across the Charleston tri-county area that we cover.  You'll learn from a team of three diagnostic medical physicists (including me) with a broad range of experience and get the opportunity to play with a lot of imaging equipment.

Let me teach you everything I know!  Questions?  Feel free to ask or send me a message.

6 months ago I would be super excited. Best of luck. Remind me in 2 years to ask about a job opportunities!
I will shoot you a message a bit later. This looks like a great program !

We hope it will be!
Can I ask how lost I'd be or if I'd even be a realistic candidate for diagnostic if all I've ever pursued is therapy? What's your day to day like and your actual tasks you perform? I've always heard diagnostic is a bunch of matlab. Is that true?Not going to lie my imaging knowledge is very rusty but I'm getting tired of rejection for therapy residency every year. Maybe I need to branch out.
	You'd probably have some catching up to do to fill in the imaging bits, but you wouldn't drown or anything.  We've currently got a few applicants already and all of them are coming from therapy backgrounds, so yours wouldn't be out of place.

Not a whole lot of Matlab here (yet, but if you want to it could be arranged), but you'll definitely be doing a lot with spreadsheets.  

My day-to-day routine varies, but the bulk of my time these days is spent performing annual performance testing on x-ray imaging equipment, shielding plans, and writing up reports.
