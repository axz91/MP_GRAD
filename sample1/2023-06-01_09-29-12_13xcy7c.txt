Post Title: Medical physics
Post Content: Jello! 
I’m finishing my bachelor/undergraduate in some weeks, and is proceedingt to my MSc in septemper. However, i’m from denmark, and have a Big interest in medical physics - onchology, but in denmark one has to complete 3 years of further Education after the 2-year MSc. My question is, does anyone have experience woth that Education? 
The programme in DK, is a “hire” at a hospital where one studies 50% of the time, and have hands on the other 50%, and completling three years of modules. I’m interested in a Ph.d too, but it seems a little weird to take 3 years of medical physics, and then 3 years of Ph.d, does anyone know if one Can combine those two?
