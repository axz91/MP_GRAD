Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school and general career topics
Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.  

Examples: 

* "I majored in hotel management in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"
Comments: 
Wisconsin vs UCLA vs UChicago:

I know that all of these are generally regarded as great medical physics PhD schools, but does anyone know which may be the best of the three? Maybe in terms of residency placements, opportunities for publishing papers, prestige, etc.
	UW residency placement is 100%, also one of largest and oldest programs in the US. Plenty of prestige if that is important to you but many would probably say that prestige is overrated. I don't know residency rates of the other schools but they should be listed somewhere on their websites - CAMPEP requires that info be listed somewhere.
		For Chicago they are 100% as well. I know prestige isn't that important but when taking about the top programs I think splitting hairs is somewhat justified. Would you consider Chicago competitive to Wisconsin?
			Like someone else said, the PI and potential projects are important considerations for schools you can't decide between. You can contact each school's admission director and they probably could give you more personalized information about their program and get you in touch with current grad students. Things like location might be important too if schools are a toss up in your mind. If you are living somewhere for 5+ years, it is nice to like the place. Eventually, if you are invited to open house interviews, that is a great way to narrow your choice down by seeing the facilities, students, and faculty in person.
				Yeah that's where I'm at right now, I've been interviewed and kinda wanted to gauge what some of the community thought about these schools. Thanks!
					Have you heard back from UCLA or UChicago yet? I also interviewed at both of those schools and have been checking my email constantly today hoping for some good news.
						Any news?
							Got an email from UChicago around 7:30pm informing me I’m waitlisted!
			I think all of them have a great reputation and perfect residency placement rates. It really depends on what field you want to work in for your Ph.D. I think your PI matters more than the program's reputation.
				Hey thanks, you are probably right. I may have the choice soon between knowing my advisor at the start at Wisconsin vs lab rotations at UChicago.
	I went through this decision a few years ago, and truthfully, I don’t think you can make a wrong choice. All are phenomenal programs with top tier faculty, residency placement, and ~prestige~. I would encourage you to consider your best “fit” for you - geographic location, city environment, social environment, and support for projects you could be interested in. Feel free to message me if you have further questions!
I’m an undergrad in medical physics right now. What do graduate courses entail? Lots of math? Or more focused on treatment and devices? Honestly don’t even know what medical physics really entails as I’m only in my second year and courses haven’t gotten too specific yet.
	Where are you pursuing your undergrad? I really want to pursue medical physics and your answer might help
	Not a lot of math; differential equations and some calculus at most. Much more conceptual than a physics undergrad.
		Sounds awesome!!!
	It's pretty ok on math for me right now. The dosimetry and radiation classes are more math heavy, but the rest is nothing anyone that went through a physics undergrad can't handle
	I thought the classes were a lot easier than undergrad - a lot more depth and less breadth. BUT I also did not struggle in my physics BS/math minor, and had taken extra classes (intro programming, biophysics, some chemistry, some math matlab course, and high school anatomy/physiology (didn't take that again in college but it sure helped).


Classis did have "math", but none of it was super intense or difficult like some of the math in physics undergrad was. There was plenty of learning how things related to medical physics work (radiation biology, diagnostic imaging machines, shielding, therapy treatment devices). Some "basic" courses like stats, ethics, and radiophysics.


Might be helpful for you to look up a specific program and find the curriculum. Perhaps look up an accredited program that is close to you and see what they are doing:
[CAMPEP programs](https://www.campep.org/campeplstgrad.asp)
I understand questions usually asked and answered revolve around the accreditation systems in the US and Canada, but I hope someone knowledgeable about processes internationally could respond as well.

I'm an international student interested in the career path for medical physics in South Africa. For reference, i'll be graduating with a three year B.Sc. in Physics this May from an Indian university, and understand that will necessitate me doing an B.Sc. Honours in the subject to qualify for Masters.

I understand that times are tough right now to get a response from respective course conveners (though I've double emailed them over a month ago and fear doing it again in case they feel harassed), so I was hoping someone from this fine subreddit could either chime in (or DM me) about getting admitted for the 2022 academic year, specifically to University of Pretoria, Wits, or Stellenbosch. 

I've been able to get a response from the convener for UCT, but if possible, could anyone free enough comment, or DM me so I could pick their brain (respectfully ofc) about their personal experience with these places, admissions, this course, and the current situation of how studies are (online vs in person, and how they could be by next year according to your knowledge) ?

Can international students register for the hpcsa (South African medical board) to become certified medical physicists and do a 2 year internship after their honours?

I've also posted twice on the r/SouthAfrica subreddit but don't think my enquiries will gain traction because my automatic upvote upon posting kept getting downvoted (I don't think it's a moderator because I didn't get an explanation or warning). 

One person did however respond with this link:  [http://www.mpijournal.org/pdf/2019-03/MPI-2019-03-p271.pdf](http://www.mpijournal.org/pdf/2019-03/MPI-2019-03-p271.pdf)  -> (a worry I have is would i be in over my head trying to vye for an education and training in a field that won't pan out in job security, would any accreditation I hope to qualify for in South Africa be acceptable elsewhere,...)

Stay coolio
Duke M.S. program:
I’ve recently been accepted into Duke’s M.S. medical physics program. I’m excited but nervous because of the large amount of loans that I’d have to take out (even after scholarship). What type of things should I be thinking about/questions should I ask as I consider this option?
	> o Duke’s M.S. medical physics program. I’m excited but nervous because of the large amount of loans that I’d have to take out (even after scholarship). What type of things should I be thinking about/questions should I ask as I consider this option?

Ask yourself why Duke. Do the residency placement stats warrant the cost? Do you want to attend a program with a large number of students? Are there other programs that cost less and provide the same or more clinical exposure?
	Duke is a great school with a great program ....kind of. The education is no doubt great but the poor residency stats are not something to gloss over. Having gone to Duke for something else it's a great school but they are in it for the $. If they can't deliver on residency I'd say it's not worth it. I also got in there and turned them down for that reason even though their program is awesome looking.

Hi,

I'm   an international student getting my MSc in medical Physics in the US.   How's the residency rate for international? Is there a lot of   difference? Should I try to get a PhD before applying to residency?

PS.:   So far I have a 4.0 GPA, going to a Diagnostic imaging route. I'll   apply to residency having worked since 2018 in an MRI lab, with   ISMRM/OHBM abstracts and a couple of manuscripts (mostly contributing   author), and trying to get some clinical training this summer/next   semester.

	I don’t really think individual programs will have preferences for citizens. The real issue you’ll run into is that about half of programs (loose estimate I am a US citizen so I never really took stock) do not sponsor visas.
	I don’t think there are stats published about citizenship of applicants but as an anecdote I know a good amount of non-US citizens who didn’t have a problem landing a residency. As long as you’re in a CAMPEP program I would assume you have the same chance as any other MSc grad. I’m currently going through the match (for therapy) and I’m not from the US, aside from making sure ahead of time the programs you're interested in sponsor visas I have not found citizenship to be a factor.
	If you're on an F1 visa, you can use STEM OPT and not need sponsoring. Sure you may have to divulge your status, but the employer wouldn't have to do anything to be able to hire you, just help you submit a training report as your supervisor. This is the route I have taken throughout residency, so if you need assistance, just message me.
		Alright! Thanks for letting me know! What happens if I already used my OPT? After I graduated I worked for around 9 months on my OPT... I know it can be renewed for 2 years with STEM, but is it possible for me? Also, how did you time the application/what did the program had to provide(documents...etc?

Best
			I applied in March time due to my anticipated graduation date and start date, you should be able to use both the extra years of STEM OPT as long as the CPT code for your graduate program identifies as STEM with department of homeland security you should be fine
	Should be ok as long as you use your OPT bc no one needs to sponsor you. But you have to time it very well. 

I couldnt time it very well :(
How are interviews going for all of my fellow match participants??
	Applied to 21 programs. Zero responses. Have my MS and decent clinical experience. Very confusing.
		Oof I'm so sorry, you're definitely not the only one in that boat though, there might be some programs hiring in the off season
	So much zoom!
		At least Zoom is better than Teams, if one more place sends me a link for Teams, I'm gonna lose it
			One program I interviewed with insisted on using webex, like bruh
	[deleted]
		Some places have been so hit or miss, I thought I would for sure get an interview at certain places and they just never contacted me 🙃
I was wondering if someone could explain the residency match program? How does it work and is it beneficial than finding your own residency programs that are not listed on the Match system?
DO you get CTs for free?
	yes but the radiologist readings are not so free.
So... is hotel management a good undergraduate major for medical physics?
	I knew a guy who started with BA in psychology. 
Comparing with that Hotel management looks better suited.
	Only if you learned about managing hotels that give complementary gamma knife upon arrival.
		Are there any other kind of hotels?
	I think as long as you have a minor in physics, you are all set
Questions about Columbia's M.S. program: Hi folks! Sorry if this has been covered before, but I was looking at Columbia's M.S. program and it looks like it's only a year and a half, i.e. Fall term 1, Spring term, Summer term, Fall term 2, graduate. Anyone who's in/has been in the program, is that accurate? How does that effect completing ABR part 1/applying to residencies???

Also, more generally, what are people's impressions of Columbia's program? I've also gotten into Oregon's M.S. program and am looking at UPenn. Any advice is appreciated!
	I'm assuming you're referring to the Columbia MS in New York? I know 4 people who went through it; three of them found research opportunities to add to their CV so they had material for residency interviews (not sure if this outside of the program or as part of it). 

Ultimately, they all ended up staying in the NYC area - one of them stayed at Columbia to lump their residency with a PhD. 

All of them seem prepared for residency but I think it's quite expensive.
