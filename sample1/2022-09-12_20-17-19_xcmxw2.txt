Post Title: Prospective medical physics entry level job openings feelers
Post Content: Hi all, just putting a feeler out there. Anyone know of any consulting or in house jobs opening up in Northern Indiana, I'm ok traveling to Illinois, Missouri and ohio for field work. Finishing up diagnostic residency next summer, mqsa certified, passed part 1, just looking for ideas in the meantime in that area.
Comments: 
They are hiring travel MP's on Indeed. They make like 5000 a week. Staffing agencies are usually oblivious to skill set and will hire anyone.
	Probably more than 5k for travel, right? Many non-travel medical physicists are making like 5k a week..
		Yeah but if you wanna break into the field and have no experience this is a good way to do it. Get yourself a camper and a KOA or other long term spot and bank all that pay and pay off debt. No need for a hotel and you can cook your own food. This is what my travel nurse friend does.
			True - also build up experience before you actually get a long-term position somewhere lol
				Great opportunity to see different parts of the country as well to make you more well rounded at your job.
		I donâ€™t think this is true for diagnostic, unfortunately.
Last thread on salaries had people saying residents were hard pressed to find starting offers under $200k right now.  Not sure if that's true or if it applies to DI though.
	Can't even wait to get done with school! All of the doctors over on the /residency board complaining about 2am nights and weekends. I am so glad I chose this over that. Tore at me for a long time. Get to help people and make a good living and actually have a normal life.
	Wow that's insane. I think it might be for therapy jobs though
