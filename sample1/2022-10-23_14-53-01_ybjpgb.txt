Post Title: Why are places advertising match residency positions on the job board?
Post Content: It feels like spam making the real jobs and non-match programs a tad more difficult to keep an eye on, the sites are not even marking these as training positions but entry level. 

But if you’re in the match, every student knows you have a residency because you’re on the match list. Are any students here looking for match residency programs on indeed and the job board?
Comments: 
Maybe it's an HR requirement at those places that they post it on their site? Just guessing.
	This is absolutely it. My current institution had such a requirement, and so did the one I attended gradschool at.
		HR is so weird, lol.
	Yeah, that’s probably it. HR at it again. Wish they’d at least put these in as training positions.
Maybe they didn't match & would still be willing to take a resident who also did not match
At least they're posting them, instead of just making a special slot for someone less qualified than you who kisses asses right on the hole.
