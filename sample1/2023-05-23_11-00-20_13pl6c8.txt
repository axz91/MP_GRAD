Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 05/23/2023
Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"
Comments: 
Is an undergrad med physics degree useful since we have to get a masters degree anyway ? Or can I study something related to physics for my undergraduate and then do a med physics masters degree?
	I have never seen an undergrad major for medical physics in the US. The vast majority of MPs major in something like physics or engineering. A minor in physics is the minimum for entry into MP grad programs.
Is there any intersection between organic chemistry and medical physics? I’m pursing a physics degree, but I’ve enjoyed organic chemistry before, so I was wondering if there are career options involving organic chemistry.
What is an "average age" to finally be a mp? I'm ~6 years out of my master's and barely make enough to keep a roof over my head. I really regret going into this field
	Are you board certified? Are you residency trained?

If you follow a “traditional” therapy mp path of undergrad (4years) -> grad school (masters, 2 years) -> residency (2 years) -> job and then board certification you should be mid-late 20’s/early 30’s. AAPM salary survey puts fresh residency grads at $100,000+. I know medical physics assistants making a very comfortable wage.

Also, you don’t just become an mp, you have to work at it. Based off of username… 🤷‍♂️
		Yup I'm aware of the process. I've been trying to get a residency for 6 years. I'm a mpa and my salary isn't comfortable
			Have you gotten honest feedback from your grad school advisors and current supervisors? I don't think that this sub can give you better advice than they can.
				My grad school was a joke and a scam. I didn't have an advisor. I did some research work for some narcissist who liked to verbally abuse me on a regular basis. But that was about it.
					You'be bashed ECU multiple times on this sub so I won't get into that, even though there are many ECU alumni that go on to residency. However, you still haven't answered the other half of my question, which is whether there is anyone who you work with right now (presumably DABRs) as an MPA that can give you frank advice about your CV or your application. This is harsh, but the fact that you haven't gotten residency (and maybe pass pt1, correct me if I'm wrong) in so many years, I have a feeling that you have one or more red flags that cause PDs to believe you cannot safely practice medical physics independently. You need to figure out what those red flags are and address them before you jump ship because those will be relevant in other industries as well.
						I know each year is different, but only one person in my class got into residency. So yeah, I'll bash ECU any time someone makes a post about them. They should have their accreditation revoked. Yeah I've had a lot of advice from someone where I work. I think my CV is fine, could be better, but not terrible. People generally don't like me. I think I'm autistic. My boss promoted someone with less experience over me because they just like them more. And yeah I struggle with standardized tests.
							>People generally don't like me.

Your bitterness definitely comes through in your reddit comments: not sure what your attitude is like at work, but my question is *what are you doing to address this?* Your own supervisor not liking you and you not interviewing successfully probably have the same root cause which has nothing to do with your grad program. There are definitely neurodiverse people who are successful in MP and other careers.
								Hell yeah I'm bitter. I worked very hard to get gatekept out of being able to make a living. I'm fine at work. Never been anything but nice. I just do my work and go home. I don't bend over backwards to be social with my boss like my coworker does. I'm never going to. I think it should be enough that I come here, be nice/easy enough to deal with, do what is expected of me, then leave.
									The majority of successful mpa’s (at least that I have met and personally worked with) who wanted to get into residency did far more than just show up, do work, leave. They got involved in as many projects as possible, reviewed the newest tg/Mppg reports to stay current, volunteered to work on monthlys/annuals, participated in special procedures, etc. This is the drive and ambition that people see which can lead to promotions and probably more importantly for you, strong letters of recommendation.
										Volunteer to do machine qa? That's part of my regular job. I've helped with about 4-ish research projects and have done in vivo dosimetry a couple times. I don't consider that extra or free work. That directly benefits my CV.
											Maybe time to look for a jump into an industry position. Likely will pay better. Use contacts you know in the field for Varian or Elekta or Accuray. Also Raysearch and Phillips and all these other companies will hire physicists to do field training. It won't be exactly what you want but it doesn't seem like you're getting what you feel like your valued right now and staying in your current position won't help.
												I want to go this route but haven't been successful so far. I feel like I crushed an interview with Sun Nuclear (literally the only time I've ever felt good about an interview). Then they straight up ghosted me. Wouldn't return emails, phone calls, idk what I did wrong there.
									As someone who's been accused of being too social and bending over backwards to be social (when in reality I would just make a concerted effort once every couple of days to check in on Dosimetry to make sure they're not freaking out, and check in with the linacs to make sure they haven't forgotten to tell me something), I think it's worth pointing out that a good, desirable medical physicist can require being social, unfortunately.

There are academic departments where medical physicists can isolate, do research, and focus on their stuff, but for a lot of smaller departments, medical physicists can be a lynch-pin in the cohesion of the dept. In some of my positions, our physicists were the only people who could talk top to bottm (from admin, directors, MDs all the way to patient transport, RTTs, Service Engineers) with a genuine appreciation of the issues at hand, and how they can affect the other members of the team, because it's our job to understand how a lot of this stuff works and the resultant causes/effects of issues. 

It's difficult to didactically train this skill up, but when I was hiring physicists, one of my primary concerns was "Will my therapists feel comfortable approaching this person if there's an issue?  Or will they feel compelled to wait until I'm back from vacation/satellite coverage/lunch because they don't want to be brushed off, sarcastically dismissed, or made to feel "not as important."

I feel bad for you that you are doing all the things you're supposed to be doing and that you're having issue breaking through the residency barrier. But unless you're a PhD student, getting into an academic position where you can silo yourself from work that's "not yours" is gonna be rough. 

It does sound like you have ample clinical experience as an MPA, which might lend you well to a job in industry, so I'd echo that recommendation. The competition might not be as stiff, too, because they typically pay less than a clinical position, but still pay very well. Have you looked into what Varian, Elekta, Sun Nuclear, etc. have listed for openings?
										I don't have a problem talking to people and checking on work related stuff. I just honestly don't care to take an interest in my boss's personal life. He doesn't care about mine. If there was a shred of reciprocity I'd be more talkative. But yeah I had a great job I was applying for at sun nuclear. Then they ghosted me, stopped returning emails, phone calls, etc. They wouldn't give any feedback at all. I feel like I nailed that interview though. But I guess I should keep looking.
											That sucks. I was ghosted so many times during my interview processes, too. You going to AAPM? Id approach some of the smaller vendors there. From what I gather, they would kill to get someone with clinical physics experience. I heard of one vendor who had been touting electron monte carlo calculation compatibility for years, and eventually had to pull a physicist aside one day and ask them what electron monte carlo even was.
												If my work foots the bill I'll go. Otherwise can't swing it. But your input does make me feel better about looking more at industry stuff

		Mp assistant, not certified can't get a residency to save my life
			If you're uncomfortable in your current position and you haven't been able to secure a residency for 6 years, I'm sure you've heard every possible trope already. "Figure out what you're missing, do some self reflection, etc". If all that has failed and nothing is changing, I personally believe it's well justified to change careers. If you want to stay within MP, maybe look towards dosimetry or RTT. A little schooling required, but you don't waste your life's efforts and can earn a very comfortable salary.
				I've seen how badly my clinic treats therapists and don't see that as an option. I've considered dosimetry and it may still be on the table.
					Yeah, RTT life isn't perfect. Like all careers, it'll depend where you work. I get the impression that their work-life balance can very consistent (usually easier to "punch in and out" as RTT than dosimetrist or physicist), but there are tradeoffs.

Is there any reason you haven't gone for dosimetry yet? You have a masters degree in MP, so that gives you a slight leg up for any future promotions to a senior/chief dosimetrist. Your path would be uncommon as most do it in the reverse order (ex: I've heard of dosimetrists going on to do medical physics graduate programs and then failing to match), but this would work very well in your circumstance.
						I was ready to jump ship a while back but several people advised me to keep trying so here we are...
Hello! I am in undergrad, currently considering Medical Physics as a post-grad career. I've heard a lot about the job from various sources and have shadowed, but there are some questions I would like to crowd-source! Thanks in advance!  
1. I am currently earning my undergraduate Bachelor's of Science in Physics. I've heard that with Medical Physics, you can either go to grad school for two years to get a Master's, or in some cases, you can do an "apprenticeship" with an established medical physicist and then take the board exam. What advice/feedback can anyone give me regarding both paths?  
2. What grad programs are good and cost-effective?  
3. Is it better to seek employment with a hospital or is it better to self-employ and do consulting work?  
4. Is consulting work in demand? (I mean, will I be able to eat?)  
5. What non-obvious places need consulting and safety certification? Doctor's offices, dentist offices, imaging centers?  
6. With employment from a hospital, are hours flexible, or is it a pretty set 9-to-5? Are most employers flexible with part-time work?  
7. The medical physicist I shadowed had his own consulting business, but mostly worked at a cancer treatment branch of a local hospital, checking the machines and confirming the radiation source returned to the machine after treatment. Is this a typical employment arrangement, or are most medical physicists directly employed by a hospital/health care system?  
8. How much of a standard undergraduate Physics curriculum is employed on a daily basis? (Are you deriving the three-dimensional Schrodinger equation between patients?)  
9. If I have the choice in my Physics electives, is it better to take more nuclear focused courses, more solid-state courses, more theoretical courses, etc? What sorts of classes are the most practical for the career?  
10. This last question is a bit more personal, and I realize it depends on the person. At my school, the assumption is that most physics major will go on to do graduate research, and eventually end up in industry or academia. I'm really not interested in either of those options, but I don't want to waste my degree. It can be hard to feel like slogging through my difficult classes is worth it, especially when I don't have a clear career path articulated by my professors, like many of my peers. So I guess my question is, is medical physics worth it? Is it a career where you can go to sleep at night satisfied with the work you've done? Is it worth the difficulty of undergrad?  
Thank you so much! I realize I have a lot of questions, and if it's not possible to answer all of them, I would be happy to have any answers to any of them. Have a wonderful day!
	Just a point about your first question: that "apprenticeship" may be referring to foreign trained medical physicists who move to the US. [https://www.theabr.org/medical-physics/initial-certification/international-medical-graduates](https://www.theabr.org/medical-physics/initial-certification/international-medical-graduates). If you are US based right now then this will not be an option for you. Look at the link in the sidebar for the options for training.
I am curently in my second year at the 5 year long medical physics program in Sweden. My goal is to some day work clinically in the US, but the process seems a lot more complicated there than over here. In Sweden we get our license from the national board of social affairs and health after 5 years at university, which also applies to any other EU country. However, in the US it seems you need to do residency and a test to recueve a license. Would I have to do all that when I already will be a licensed medical physicist in the EU?
Hello!
I’ve been outside the field for a couple of years now, I’m aiming to pursue a PhD program hopefully next year, meanwhile I’m looking for a research opportunity but I ve been emailing professors with no luck yet, any advices ?? Should I do a masters instead ? To easy my way back to the field ? I would appreciate some advice
	What is your current profession and previous educational background? What is your primary motivation?
		BS Physics, post BS medical imaging, currently I’m doing most public policy work. I have always wanted to go back to school and continue with my education, life happened and drove me in a different direction, I’ve been off the field for almost 5 years now. I try to keep myself updated with bibliography
			You have a very strong background for Medical Physics if your GPA and references are good. Direct application to PhD is not unreasonable. If you have meaningful research experience or published anything in your current position, I think you have a good chance of acceptance with at least one program. 

In your circumstance, I don't see any reason to do a masters first as you already have a strong background in a related field. You would just be wasting a lot of time and money if would still do a PhD afterwards. 

Your most important priority, which it seems you've already identified, is to prove you're interested in research/academia in some form. Cold e-mailing professors is difficult, I know for my university a lot of external emails go straight to spam. They may also have no reason to trust you, and have a list of dozens of other things to do or people to collaborate with. Try emailing faculty from smaller or less established PhD programs. If that doesn't work, think about doing something non-traditional to prove your academic interest - maybe your current job has some kind of opportunity, like teaching or creating an academic-style blog.
				Thanks for the advice, I will Definitely apply directly, exploring the best options always. If you heard about any research opportunity I will appreciate the share. I truly want to work on my research skills meanwhile.
