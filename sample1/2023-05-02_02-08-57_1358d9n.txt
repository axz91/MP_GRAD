Post Title: What to expect in an interview with oncologists?
Post Content: Hello. I am about to have a second interview for the position of Junior Physicist at a rad onc clinic. This meeting will be with the oncologists.

What kind of questions can I expect and what can I do to prepare? Thanks for any suggestions.

I don't recall getting asked a single clinical question by an oncologist in an interview.  I think primarily they want to know if you're someone who is good to work with.  They're very busy,  plan reviews,  consults,  follow ups,  imaging reviews,  etc,  etc.  They want to know that you're a good communicator and that you won't waste their time. Just try to be friendly and personable.
	+100! Don't waste their time. Show that you can add value to their practice. One thing you could ask them is what's good about their current physics support? Anything that they would like to see improve?
I wouldn't specifically prepare for anything with the oncologists.

They will just try to gauge if you're a good fit, they (should) know that they won't be able to tell anything about your clinical skills in an interview, and should leave that assessment to the chief physicist.

You should really be assessing them as well during the interview though. You will be working with them in the clinic, and if they are difficult in the interview, they will be worse on a day to day basis. If any of them *do* try to challenge you with physics questions in the interview, I'd go as far as to say that's a red flag.
As others said, nothing to prepare. Be a good small talker and be able to present yourself in a friendly and courteous manner.

Try to get an impression of how they treat their physicists. Is there mutual respect or just a master and slave relationship?
What are their research specialities? Any new techniques or treatment devices they plan on getting in the next year(s)?
