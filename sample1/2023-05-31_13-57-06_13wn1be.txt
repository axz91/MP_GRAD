Post Title: Part-time medical physics
Post Content: I was wondering if anyone has had experience with part time medical physics work. Specifically, how did you obtain it and what did the hours look like? I'm interested in part time clinical medical physics work including QC, rad safety, etc.

You could try asking any consulting firms if they have any part time work available. They may have a specific clinic under contract that only needs staffing on certain days or until noon or something.
I work three days per week, 8 hour days. Long term position, I asked, they said yes. It's pretty win.
