Post Title: Non-Profit/Government Industry Organization
Post Content: So, I have an odd-ish question about potential employers in the industry realm. 

To give a short background, I am currently a med phys resident in a rad onc department. I am enjoying my experience without a doubt, but as I move through the program I am beginning to realize that I would like a career with a better work/life balance and have been considering industry positions, seeing as these positions are typically more likely to have WFH or non-"5-8-hr" days (quotes because we all know clinical physicists work way more than that).  The only caveat I have is that with the new PSLF program, working for a non-profit/government organization allows me to have my student loans forgiven after 10 yr of un-missed payments, which is a huge bonus as a clinical physicist because it is easy to find a non-profit hospital. 

Therefore this leads me to my question: what companies in the industry realm of medical physics would fall into those categories of non-profit or government agencies? Looking at the larger two (Varian and Elekta), it doesn't seem like they would. I was wondering if somebody else here may be in a similar position or if there is anybody who currently works for a company that is a non-profit or government organization.

Thanks in advance!

You are correct that most (all?) of the industrial medical physics positions won't be in the non-profit realm. There was just an AMA with the Non-Clinical Working Group that touches on government positions. In particular you might want to reach out to /u/PhotonClub for insights into working for the FDA.

Two things to consider:

1. I almost never work more than 40 hour weeks. Usually closer to 35 hours. It all depends where you get hired, but work life balance is absolutely achievable as a clinical physicist.

2. PSLF is only applicable for certain repayment plans (income driven repayment, for example). I personally didn’t have any student loans, but I looked into this for my wife. Basically she makes too much money for PSLF to work for her. Because her monthly loan repayment is income-driven, paying those large monthly bills for 10 years would pay off the entirety of her loans, rendering PSLF worthless. If she chose a repayment option with lower monthly payments it wouldn’t qualify for PSLF. YMMV, but dig into that more before you commit to that path.
	Thanks for the response! 
So, I as a resident I actually already qualify for PSLF and am now in the application process for IDR. The amount of student debt I have is a sickly amount and it is not feasible to make the standard payment and be able to live, so I should have no problem being approved.
If you don’t mind my asking, what type of clinic do you work in that you’re only working 35 hrs a week? 
I am looking to find something more Hybrid because the hours don’t necessarily bother me, the time away from my family does.
		You may be approved now as a resident, but when you get hired as a staff physicist making $150k, it may no longer work out. I hope it does, but just fair warning.

I work in a large, non-academic healthcare system. We have 5 physicists and 1 physics assistant covering 5 clinics. Our clinics are treating anywhere from 12 to 35 patients per day. And we typically have time to do all monthly and annual QA during normal business hours. The physics assistant is a HUGE benefit to the group.
			I appreciate the warning and it is definitely something worth considering. If I no longer qualify for IDR then hopefully once I am making 150k I can afford a standard payment. ;) However, even post-residency my student debt will be higher than my annual income (yes, even making 150k), which is one of the eligibility requirements for IDR. FSA also reports that if the income ever does exceed the amount of debt, then I would still be on the IDR, but would have to make standard payment. Who knows! Fingers crossed. 

Well, if around June 2024 you need another physicist to come on board, let me know lol. That is good to know though that there are clinical roles where I can still maintain a proper work/life balance.
