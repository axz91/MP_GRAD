Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 04/18/2023
Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"

How hard is it to find a good paying job after Masters? Hello, I am a 3rd year medical physics student and I plan to pursue a masters degree but I'm just wonder how difficult it would be to find a well paying job? I mostly want to got into research but I would got into other fields if they have better potential pay and career progression opportunities. I'm in Canada for extra info
	In lieu of a Canadian chiming in here (Im sure someone will eventually), as someone in the US who regularly interacts with Canadians, it seems to be difficult to pursue a *clinical* career without a PhD. If academia is similar in Canada, it can be difficult to get far research-wise without a PhD as well. Not impossible for either, just an uphill battle. 

Again, these are not my personal experience, so, grain of salt and all that. That said, I feel like this has been discussed previously here, have you tried searching for a related thread?
What are the experiences in having residency in a consulting organization versus hospital? Why should one prefer one? or what are the expectations that are peculiar to either?
	One of my cohort went into one of the bigger consulting (therapy) residencies, and I went into a hospital residency. I can't speak a lot about it since we don't talk to often, but from what he mentioned he felt pretty overworked in comparison to my other cohort and myself. He was working 60-70 hours a week and most weekends, apparently. At some point you begin to wonder if they're even interested in actually teaching. 

While I have had periods of time where I work similar hours due to things piling up (annuals and lots of special brachy procedures, for example), but it's rare and often times great learning experiences. I average 45-50 hours most weeks. I can't speak to anything beyond that, and its a sample size of one.
		Thank you so much
