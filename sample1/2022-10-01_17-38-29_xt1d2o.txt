Post Title: Are any of you practicing medical physicists with a health restriction that prevents you from entering an MRI room (pacemaker, insulin pump/sensor, etc.)?
Post Content: How do you handle your responsibilities in a clinic with an MRI linac? Have you faced any challenges getting a position in certain clinics?
Comments: 
I have not, but I would refer you to contact the chair of the newly minted accessibility working group under the EDI committee.  Perhaps they could be of assistance and offer guidance.
I do not have such a condition, nor do I work with an MRI linac, but I can't imagine you'd be hired as a physicist at a site where you couldn't even go into the room.
	MRI linacs are often located at larger institutions with many service lines - at my own institution fewer than half of our physicists have anything to do with the MR-Linac. If you exclude brachytherapy as well (we have dedicated MR), we still have several people that could conceivably have such a condition and still be gainfully employed.
