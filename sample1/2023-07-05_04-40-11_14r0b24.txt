Post Title: MPA Pay
Post Content: What are MPAs making and what are their qualifications? Really need some high quality sources but if anyone wants to share their personal experience that would be helpful as well.

There was a post a few years ago asking this question but there wasn’t much of a response. One respondent said the average was $40k but that seems low.

I’m sure this varies with the tasks asked of the MPA. Ours do all routine machine and patient QA with the exception of output on monthly tests and TG-51 on annual tests. They are required to have a bachelors in phys or related.
Comments: 
Huge range out there depending on how the employer views the MPA position.

In my experience, places that value the MPA role and treat it as a career position rather than a transient stopgap pay somewhere in the ballpark of 40% of a QMP salary.
MPA at my facility makes $95k. He was a former biomed engineer covering our linacs, then transitioned to this role.
MPAs at my place (diagnostic, academic center) start at >70k. Bachelors in physical science is minimum requirement.
	This is similar to my place (diagnostic only). We have a short trial period where the pay is less, but no one has ever left or been let go during it.
A quick and dirty way to check is looking at states with salary range transparency laws, then checking MPA and QMP pay at institutions in that state.

Anecdotal data for a fresh undergrad physics grad is about $30/hr minimum at several academic affiliated centers.
Same as a PGY-1 resident for us
MPA position here requires MS in Med Phys but pays $76k. They performed patient QA and monthlies/annuals except output measurements.
45k ish here and no view in sight of ever being certified. I have a MS but we realistically take anyone with a science bachelor's. I'm in the struggle. Too easy to take out a mountain of debt when you expect to make 100k+
I have a BS in physics and make 80k as an MPA
