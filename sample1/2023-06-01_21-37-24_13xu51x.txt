Post Title: Junior Medical Physicist
Post Content: What is a general definition of a Junior Medical Physicist with Residency programs? It's a junior Medical Physicist a person that finished Residency but not passed all the ABR exams?

That’s becoming more the trend. Back in the way back days of 2016 it meant a physicist coming straight from grad school (since residency wasn’t part of board eligibility). Still not board certified though.
The term has mostly fallen out of use but I would interpret it as not board certified yet since most of your work needs to be signed off on by a board certified physicist. Once you're board certified, you're just a physicist or staff physicist.

That tends to be the term in current times.  It used be more conflated with Medical Physics Asssistants and non-board eligible physicists, but those things have become better defined.
That is the way I interpreted it. But often they get used like residents.
I would say a physicist who needs a supervision of the Senior Physicist at work. I think a fresh DABR is still Junior Physicist until they become knowledgeable and independent at most procedures.
	I would expect even a fresh DABR to be independent in pretty much everything maybe with the exception of program/machine commissioning
