Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 11/01/2022
Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"

What is the difference between MS+ Residency VS DMP?
	DMP doesn't require you to go through the process of finding a residency (which for master's students can be competitive). The major downside is that you have to pay for your residency if you do a DMP. In an MS, you only have to pay for the master's degree, then you get paid for residency. All in all MS + residency is more affordable. Otherwise I wouldn't think of the degrees as that different, look into specific programs and see if they fit your needs, DMP programs will give information about how they think their degree stands out from a master's (like more of a clinical focus). In my honest opinion, having to pay for residency doesn't sound great, but on the other hand I hear it can be hard to get a residency with a Master's.
		Also note that while residency slots are increasing each year, DMP programs as a whole are not (1 or 2 have actually shut down in the past few years if I'm not mistaken).
I'm an undergraduate student in America set on medical physics. Is it worth it for me to do a PhD instead of a master's if I'm planning to work as a clinical physicist?
	You won't get a residency unless you are very well connected. It is simply too saturated with extremely overqualified candidates to the point where the position is not entry level for MS people.
	Depends. PhDs do have higher match rates, but MS isn't bad at ~60-70% (the figure isn't removing people who have no business applying such as those from entirely different fields from non-CAMPEP programs, so the true figure is likely higher). That said, you absolutely do NOT need a PhD to get into residency. My entire cohort of MS graduates matched. Half of my current residency cohort is MS and those that just graduated were all MS. I've had multiple program directors explicitly tell me they prefer MS applicants since they tend to hit the ground running due to the typically more clinically-focused programs. Some programs are actually PhD or MS-only even.

Get into a strong, reputable program (LSU, UKentucky, Penn, Wayne State, among a few others mentioned in this sub) with good clinical experience (VERY key), do well, learn your stuff well, get as much exposure as you can, interview well, etc. I'd be shocked if you didn't into a decent program. I wouldn't call myself a particularly strong applicant. I just had the experience from a decently strong program and interviewed well. Landed at a great place where I feel Im learning a LOT and love my coworkers and mentors. Ultimately, it'll be your own unique experience that may or may not be similar to ours, so weigh the options. Hope this helps.
Hi everyone, I really want to pursue medical physics but have a few concerns/questions, I'll try to keep it short

-Im 25, have a BS in Exercise Science and am pursuing a BS in Radiation Therapy
-I have only taken introductory physics 1 and 2 (not calc based) and calculus 1, no other physics courses
-Im wondering the best course of action since I believe you need the equivalent of a physics minor to be considered
-Should I just chip away at the prerequisites each semester?
-Lastly, will I be able to still work as a radiation therapist while going for my masters? (I know for residency that's not an option)

Any advice is greatly appreciated!!!
Advice 

I'm currently taking Psychology as my pre-med course, and still in my freshman year. I'm planning to switch to Med Tech if it'll make me possibly take Graduate Degree in Medical Physics. There is no Physics or RadTech Major near my hometown so I have no other choices. I've done my research and I couldn't find any posts regarding this question. Do you have any other options before I do action? And I'm still in my First Sem Midterms. Please help, Respect & TYIA
	Are you studying in the US or elsewhere? What are your ultimate goals? Youâ€™re looking to get a graduate degree in medical physics following graduation from your undergrad? Iâ€™m just clarifying because I saw premed thrown in there
		I live here in the Philippines, planning to move to Canada after graduation to continue my studying.
			In another comment on /r/premed you said "Medical School for Medical Physics" so I just want to clarify if your career goal is to become a physician (In Canada that would be an MD Doctor of Medicine) or a clinical medical physicist (MSc or PhD in Medical Physics). 

If the answer is physician then you'll have better luck asking on other subreddits but generally medical school is fairly forgiving in terms of undergraduate major. However, if the answer is clinical medical physicist you'll want at minimum a minor in physics as to practice clinically in North America you'll programs which are CAMPEP accredited and that is their requirement. 

The specific requirement from the CAMPEP documents is "Students entering a medical physics graduate educational program shall have a strong
foundation in basic physics. This shall be demonstrated either by an undergraduate or graduate degree in physics, or by a degree in an engineering discipline or another of the physical sciences and with coursework that is the equivalent of a minor in physics (i.e., one that includes at least three upper-level undergraduate physics courses that would be required for a physics major)."

	You have to give us more background, as  scienceplz said. However, just finish all courses this semester. No need to drop everything. If you are in the US, pretty sure the courses in first semester are general and you can use them to fulfill electives.
		Was Medtech good for alternatives?
			I guess you'll have to ask your college, but I am assuming you are doing something like Algebra I, Psychology I, English composition...general stuff. I mean, you can finish this semester. More harm will be done if you drop the classes mid semester: if they let you join other classes, you have to catch up half a semester and that is tough. If they don't let you join other classes, then maybe you just lose your tuition and don't get any credits. I read you are from the Philippines.

If you wanna go to the US or Canada, think about careers that grant a work visa or further studies. Being a technologist might not be worthy of a work visa (I was an Nuc Med technologist once and I had to come back to do MedPhys so I could be sponsored), since there are many people with that degree. Also being a technologist in a certain area might not have a path towards more education (cannot continue to MS or PhD). For example, I had to go back to school to get all my physics classes before enrolling in MP master's degree. I couldn't do it with my technologist degree. And even if you become a technologist graduated in the US or in Canada, you might have to go back home afterwards because no one will want to sponsor a foreign person when there are so many Americans/Canadians with the same degree waiting to be hired. Sponsoring costs money to employers. So if you come back, better be for some graduate degree desirable for employers. Do some research on which professions would help you with immigration. I know this is tough to hear, but it is something I wish someone had told me when I was in undergrad.

You must have some profession that is considered a specialty profession: scientist, mathematician, biologist, MD, etc (medical physics is good too). Check out medical technology. I have heard some people coming for masters in medical technology (as in, medical technology, microbiology, laboratorist) and then going for MS, PhD and becoming scientists...so it depends.  Then you could go to canada or US for a job or graduate education and then a job.
				Last question, sorry to bother you but I just wanted to clear out my mind. Do you think Universities will consider it if I'll get a certificate from online courses like Harvard, Stanford, etc etc? Big thanks to you ðŸ™Œ
					As kerma said, for grad admissions they want all of that. For furthering your education and being able to get admited for graduate school in canada or us you dont want a certificate, you want a solid bachelorâ€™s degree. Many careers that are terminal (do not offer MS or PhD) are offered in certificates. 

You might be better off finishing your semester now with good grades, so you dont waste it, and talking to an academic counselor in the meantime for next semester. You could continue on getting your MD and then traveling for residency or getting degrees in STEM with a clear path to grad school. I know it feels like a lot but you are very early on this. Take it step by step.
					Probably not for grad admissions. They want to see high GPA, good LoRs, and relevant research/work experience. Another thing to pay attention to is your personal statement; writing and communicating well is crucial for success in academia and medicine, and your personal statement should reflect both your communication skills and your motivation to pursue this career path.
						So my only option is to take another undergrad degree or proceed with the course I am taking/switch courses? :((
							It's still not clear to me what your primary major is, and where you are completing it.
