Post Title: Considering career move from Canada to USA
Post Content: With the cost of living increasing so drastically all over Ontario the last few years (why is owning a decent house a pipe dream without an inheritance??), I’ve been seriously considering a move to America. It seems like this is a recent trend (I know 3 physicists in the GTA + surrounding area who did this in 2022 alone) and from a financial perspective, I really can’t see how it could be a bad move.

Take New York (which is about 4 – 5 hours drive from here) for example. With pay transparency now, you can see that MP positions pay about $190k+ USD (\~250k+ CAD). In comparison, our Ontario collective agreement has a MP with 5 years experience maxing out around 170k CAD. For a pay gap that substantial, the monthly cost of living in the US would have to be significantly higher (to the tune of thousands of dollars per month) for an equivalent lifestyle when compared to Ontario.

I love my country and never thought I would consider leaving it… but it’s getting harder for me to justify staying here. Apart from leaving my extended family (which people have done for economic gain for generations), I really don’t know what’s keeping me here other than an aversion to change and free healthcare. Especially when I could move a relatively short distance away geographically and have what appears to be a very much improved quality of life.

Are there any MPs that have practised in Canada then moved to the States (or have just always worked in the States) that can chime in? I’m really curious to hear about your experiences. I know our clinical practice is different here vs in the States (e.g. different working hours, different focus on research/teaching, more QA due to the lack of physics assistants/associates)... but is there anything else - professional or otherwise - that I’m overlooking?

EDIT: To increase the relevance to others. Canadian physicists: have you considered relocating? What keeps you from doing so? American physicists: based on what you know about the Canadian system, would you ever consider relocating here for a role paying \~120k USD?
Comments: 
Fellow Canadian physicist who's not thinking of moving to the US in the foreseeable future, so I haven't looked into the actual numbers. Off the top of my head though there are some things to consider:

1. NYC is quite a bit more expensive than Toronto, like 30-50% more from a quick google search, and with potentially longer commutes as well. Or see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/pisnqr/new_york_re_versus_toronto_re_us_seems_relatively/) about real estate in the two cities. If you plan on having kids, everything childcare or education related is also more expensive.

2. From the people I know, on average hours are significantly longer in the US and the pressures on the job are higher. It's quite common to have 50 hour work weeks. The increase in stress level with any additional work hour is not linear. It is very much exponential, especially if you have kids, plus two 1-hour commutes every day. But if you want a more competitive environment, then it might be a good choice for you.
	A key thing anywhere is to make a great salary in a low cost area. Making 240k in NYC is silly when you can make the same in Ohio...
	Thanks for bringing up the cost of living point! I've thought about it a lot, and I'm beginning to view cost of living as a bit of a red herring when you get to a certain level of income though. 

I mean, if my monthly cost of living increases by 50% (say from $6k to $9k, just as an example) but my salary increases from the equivalent of 160k to 250k, to me, the increase in CoL is tolerable. That is, assuming taxes aren't significantly higher also ;)

The difference in weekly work hours are a definite con on the job responsibilities side of things. Working more than the "standard" 37.5h is pretty much a given any week at my centre (which admittedly is partially by choice), but I'm very seldom putting in more than 50 hours. To have that be the expectation would be exhausting!
Be prepared to deal with "insurance verification" ...as in, patients getting complicated 3D plans because that's what insurance will cover, even though a VMAT plan would be better and more streamlined for everyone involved. Or, when a doctor wants a VMAT plan, and insurance says "you could probably do this with 3D," so you have to do extra work making a 3D plan to demonstrate, "no, this would violated these dose constraints."  I came to the US after grad school to do a postdoc, residency, and then start clinical work. So, I've never worked in the clinic in Canada. But, sometimes I pine for the life where "what the doctor orders" is what you do, rather than "what will insurance cover." And yes, you could easily find yourself in a scenario where you're understaffed, underappreciated, and you're expected to "work until the job is done." Places where physicists work 50+ hours every week are more common than they should be down here.  


But, you're right, the pay difference is SUBSTANTIAL. I'm aware of the pay salary surveys in both countries, and 3.5 years out of residency, I am making more than Canadian physicists nearing retirement.  


Some not so charming features of the US:  
\- fear of having an expensive medical incident  
\- fear of getting into a minor car accident, but someone suing you for a payday  
\- guns/shootings  
\- finding yourself in a scenario where seeking a change would involve significant barriers (e.g., having a work visa tied to a specific employer, and you legal residency tied to your work visa, so if you want to change jobs there is A LOT of red tape to cut through)  


On the positive side:  
\- the people were a lot friendlier than I expected
	Oh, also: schools  
\- I already mentioned shootings, but it bears repeating  
\- I don't have kids, but I have heard from A LOT of folks down here that public schools are not great (which explains a lot #shade), so they end up having to send their kids to private school, which can get expensive

\- college/university is VERY expensive, as in hundreds of thousands of dollars
		Some public schools are great, but they’re usually in areas with more expensive housing. But a physicist should be able to afford it. I don’t live in NY anymore, but where I am now, it’s worth it to pay up to live in the better school district versus sending kids to private school. The private school ends up being more expensive in the long run and the public school is pretty good.
		Having to deal with insurance sounds like it would be pretty trying. I can't imagine having to do extra work to 3Dplan something just to prove that you can't meet constraints and then doing it with VMAT anyways. That completely blows my mind, and I imagine it would be quite frustrating to deal with (depending on the frequency).

Your list of not so charming points have definitely been weighing on my mind. Glad you mentioned child expenses (including education) because that's something I hadn't thought of that will be a consideration going forward.
			That happens, but it's usually the dosimetrist having to do that here. I've never had to do it. Typically a physicist will only do SRS/SBRT or HDR planning here, with dosimetrists handling the rest. Some facilities the physicists don't do any planning, it's all done by dosimetrists. Not sure if it's like that in Canada.
		You forgot to add watch out for heart disease and diabetes!
			Yeah, that's one thing I did notice when I first moved here and forgot. Canada's #1 cause of death: cancer. USA's #1 cause of death: heart disease. (At least, those were the figures when I moved here in 2015. Haven't checked in a while, but I don't imagine that's changed much.)
				i was mostly joking :)
In addition to some of the differences in taxation, healthcare and education cost that were well detailed in other comments, I think the US tends to offer less vacation and time off than other countries. Typically maybe 3 weeks a year for vacation and that may include any sick days. [That may go up a little with seniority but not very substantially] Paid maternity (and especially paternity) time off is no guarantee.
	Great point to consider, especially about the mat/pat leave. I've heard there are pretty significant differences in parental leave policies \[e.g. who pays (employer vs government), duration (3 months vs 12-18), and top-up\] between the two countries. Do you know if it varies by state also?
		Here is a link to state by state differences on maternity leave. Any special consideration for paternity leave is atypical here. It does seem that New York has quite good (paid) maternity leave protection compared to other states.

https://www.paycor.com/resource-center/articles/maternity-leave-laws-by-state/

FMLA (Family Medical Leave Act) guarantees time off for events like this, but is often not paid time but unpaid. It usually tops out at 12 weeks in many states and employment arrangements.  If the leave is unpaid, people must use accrued PTO (paid-time-off) hours or vacation days to be paid, in that scenario.  Also of note, the 12 weeks common of FMLA can be maxed out to the detriment of the employee.  A historical horrific anecdote I heard from my department (which happened before I started there) -- a staff member had cancer, maxed the PTO and FMLA but still was not healthy enough to return to work, and was subsequently fired (FMLA doesn't just apply to a birth, but also situations like illness or bereavement).
		Generally the legislation only applies for 12 weeks, unpaid, for the mother. But individual employers are much more generous.

My generous employer will offer fully paid parental leave for up to 12 weeks, however you have to deplete your vacations and sick days first. And then you have none when you go back to work with a child.
You’ll still be required to do “Canadian Fractionation”, though.  No escaping that… :)

Seriously, consider taxes and healthcare costs, which I’m told are way different between the countries, if you are doing it for financial reasons.
- You may have to pay taxes in both countries (at least for the first year of transition, maybe more).
- There is a 15% Social Security & Medicare tax (called FICA) that, if Republicans get their way, you will not get back in benefits (ever).  Note that the employer pays half, so people claim it’s a 7.5% tax, but if the employer didn’t have to pay it then they’d be able to contribute it to your salary, so in effect, you ARE paying for it, but not paying it directly… clear as mud?
- healthcare costs come in terms of premiums (fixed cost based on age & number of family members covered) and a confusing array of costs that are both hard to estimate (depend on what goes wrong) and, under some circumstances, can be overwhelmingly expensive, like US$100k.  There is a “no medical surprise bills” law in the US, but it doesn’t cover everything, like Dental insurance.  If you are not part of a group insurance plan, you’ll pay premiums of US$25k for a family of 4.  That’s before using even a single medical service.
- Costs of living differ.  You still can’t afford to buy any property in NYC at US$190k, so I presume you are talking about upstate.
- There are strange local taxes, too, sometimes up to 8%, that depend on which town or county you reside in, or where you buy your goods/services.  Basically, you never know the price of anything within 10% until they ask for payment, if you travel outside your town.  Also, goods are classified as taxable, untaxable, and vice taxable (liquor), based on local ordinances.
- Some locations will make you pay taxes on untaxed online purchases, a sneaky tax that you’ll find out about a year after you buy something.

Good thing you are asking…

There are many other considerations… culture, politics, inheritance taxes, acceptance of Canadians, and measuring things in non-metric systems.  :)
	You can buy property in NYC with a salary of $190k. My wife and I bought a co-op apartment for $500k with a combined income of about $200k. That was just a few years ago.

Obviously it was nothing fancy. Just a 2 bed 1 bath apartment in Queens.

If you’re single you could live cheap for a few years and save up a down payment. My wife made $50k and she managed to save over $20k in a few years, so it’s possible to save enough with a salary of $190k

Plus, I think a lot of physicists in NYC make more than that. I left NYC but I’d be making over $160k as a dosimetrist if I’d stayed (just adjusting my previous salary with annual raises). And I know that some of my fellow dosimetrists were making more than I was in non-supervisory roles
		I read that prices have doubled in the last 2-3 years.  Could you check on the price of that condo again and tell me if that rumor is true, please?
			Definitely not true. Housing prices in my old neighborhood are unchanged as far as I can tell. Prices dropped after covid because so many people moved away. They’ve bounced back, but they didn’t rise the way they did everywhere else in the country.

I see 2 bed, 1 bath apartments in my old neighborhood listed for around $500k still.

Prices actually dropped in my neighborhood. We sold for 475k, but some of our neighbors in identical units in our building sold for much less. This was in mid 2021. I can’t tell if prices are still lower or if they’ve reached their old levels from 2019.

Anyway, they definitely have not doubled in the city. Prices in the suburbs did shoot up as people left the city and started working from home, but I really doubt they doubled.
				Good to know.  Thanks for doing the research.  I wonder if this “city prices leveled out while suburbs doubled” was common in many cities?
		I am sure they could say the same thing about Toronto.  I would never recommend someone escaping Canadian Inflation get into NYC real estate…. It is insane.  And the salary range they are talking about would cost over 50% in taxes in NYC.  I made about the same money and paid 56% in income taxes.
	>There is a 15% Social Security & Medicare tax (called FICA) that, if Republicans get their way, you will not get back in benefits (ever).  Note that the employer pays half, so people claim it’s a 7.5% tax, but if the employer didn’t have to pay it then they’d be able to contribute it to your salary, so in effect, you ARE paying for it, but not paying it directly… clear as mud?

Canadians also pay for the CPP which is 5.7+5.7=11.4% and the unemployment insurance which is 1.63+2.282=3.912% for a total of 15.3%, so it's not that different. The main difference is that the CPP and EI contributions stop after the first \~60K, whereas the social security insurable income is until \~150K, and medicare actually gets **more** expensive after that, so you do end up paying more in the US than in Canada overall. But in concept it's not really a big difference between both countries.
		So the SO needs to know this b/c the desired salary will be > $147k.  Medicare is only 2.9% in that stratospheric salary range, so it’s not as substantial an impact as the full 15%, luckily for him/her.

As a non-US citizen, would the SO actually get SS benefits when retired?  I’ve read that immigrants don’t get payments, but are required to pay into the system, which seems very unfair IMHO.  At that point, it might make sense to apply for dual citizenship upon moving to the US, and hope that politicians don’t restrict those particular benefits in the future (which some Republicans have stated that they wish to do).
			You can receive SS benefits either if you are a resident, or a citizen. If you move away from the US as a non-citizen, you get no SS, despite paying all of your life into it. 

There's a totalization agreement but it's bullshit. It only serves to make you eligible for benefits, but it doesn't increase your payout.

The person who moves to the US for a job must understand that they will either need to stay there for the rest of their life, or become a citizen if they want to retire in Canada.
				Thank you!
	Thanks for taking the time to post your comment... a lot of great points to consider!

I was indeed thinking upstate NY (sorry, should have specified). I suspect you're bang on about there being little benefit to the increased salary if going somewhere like NYC. Other places in close proximity (e.g. Philadelphia, New Jersey) might have a lower cost of living, and perhaps (?) comparable compensation so are also locations to potentially consider...

   
What your comment (and others) have highlighted is that I'm very unaware of exactly how health care expenses work south of the border, and how they can quickly grow to be in the tens of thousands of dollars. Really educating myself on the way different states handle taxes also seems like a must if I want to objectively compare these scenarios further.
	RE: "You may have to pay taxes in both countries"  


As I understand it, the US and Canada have a tax treaty that means you just pay income taxes in each country for the incomes earned in each country. At least, that's what I've been doing. I moved from Canada to US in mid-2015 and I have lived in the US ever since. I've only submitted tax returns to each country when I earned incomes there. To cover my butt, I had an H&R Block representative in the US who is familiar with US/Canada tax laws do my taxes for the first few years, and this is what he had me do. Since then, I've only earned income in the US, so I've just used the standard H&R Block "file your taxes online" service and paid taxes to the US govt.   


If I've been doing something wrong, neither Canadian or US tax folks have come knocking on my door yet, so... \*shrug\*
		Good info!  I was thinking of the transition year in which income is earned in both countries.  Is it your experience that this year will be more tax-heavy that the following years?  (Moving on January 1 seems like a good idea, to avoid that).
			Definitely recommend moving in january to make a clean break. Much easier that way.

Remember that it takes time for your last paycheck etc... so you want to  quit soon before christmas.
				In the US, personal taxes (as opposed to businesses, like an s-corp or LLC that you own) are on a “cash” basis, that is, you file taxes on money *deposited* into your account on the date of deposit (eg, in that tax year).

So if you quit in December and get a direct deposit on payday, you’re good to go.  However, if you get a physical check (severance pay or pay-out for unused vaca/sick time) and get around to depositing it Jan 1, you’re paying taxes on that in the next year.

Do Canadian tax-free retirement accounts exist?  If so, you might want to transfer that to a US equivalent, if allowed.

OTOH, if you started a contracting business to receive that income (some physicists are considered independent contractors thru a company), you have choices as to which year you credit the income.  Expenses have a similar split, but can be more complex, as you can send money to your retirement account up to tax day the next year, and take the deduction in the prior year.  AFAIK, expenses on a cash basis are the date that the money is taken from your account, not the date you sent the payment (ex, mailed the check).

Upshot: it’s complicated.  Get a tax pro to plan out your move if you want to minimize taxes.
					>In the US, personal taxes (as opposed to businesses, like an s-corp or LLC that you own) are on a “cash” basis, that is, you file taxes on money deposited into your account on the date of deposit (eg, in that tax year).

I was under the impression that it's the same for Canada.

>Do Canadian tax-free retirement accounts exist? If so, you might want to transfer that to a US equivalent, if allowed.

Tax-free retirement accounts like the RRSP and TFSA do exist, but you don't get to transfer from Canada to the US. You can leave them in Canada or cash them out (and pay the tax), transfer to Canada, and then contribute as per US rules. I've left mine in Canada.

TFSA are not considered pension in the US so are not exempt from taxation, the common wisdom is to cash them out because there is only work in reporting them, and no benefit. RRSPs can continue to grow tax-free until distribution.

>OTOH, if you started a contracting business to receive that income (some physicists are considered independent contractors thru a company)

Most people will get a proper job at a proper clinic just like they had in Canada, and for them it's not nearly that complicated. They get personal income and follow the common rules. 

I agree that if you work as a consultant or self-employed it's much more complex.
						“proper job”.  I snicker at this only because it’s way more restricted in terms of retirement benefits. One’s employer can dictate the terms to you and you have no choice.  For example, I was *required* to contribute 6% of income to a retirement plan that paid minimal interest.  I could voluntarily contribute more, but who would want to?
							That's one job. Mine allows me to self-direct my investment into a choice of Vanguard ETFs.

I get 7.25% of my salary for free, and I can contribute up to 22 500$x2 (401K + 457b each have separate contribution limits), for a total of \~60K a year, split either ROTH or traditional. And then there's individual retirement accounts (IRA) on top of that.

In Canada I could never contribute anywhere close to that.
						So many acronyms!!
That is my situation. I am a Canadian-trained physicist who has moved to the US around 2015, attempted to come back to Canada during the Pandemic, but ultimately decided to stay in the US.

Like you I live my country and never considered leaving it. My year was very difficult in terms of hiring, and I failed to get an academic job in Canada. I could have stayed for a clinical job, or I could go to the US for a much better position. I chose the latter.

I started at 135K USD back then. I am now making 200K USD. In Canada, I could expect 170K CAD, as generally getting hired straight into a senior physicist role (where such exist - BC, Alberta, Ontario, Saskatchewan only I believe) is extremely difficult. The locals have been waiting behind the red tape to be promoted for years, so for them to give it to an outsider? They better be Van Herk-level.

In general, the cost of living in the US is much **lower**. Everything is cheaper. Food at the groceries, restaurants, gasoline, transportation (especially flying!). Housing will highly depend on where you live, but generally it is still much cheaper in the US.

Income taxes can be relatively similar or much lower, depending on the state in which you live. Taxes in alberta would be less than what I pay, but taxes in Nova Scotia or Quebec would be higher. The sales taxes are much lower, around 5%. Property taxes tend to be quite high as that's what pays for schooling - around 10-20 000$ a year.

In terms of benefits, I am privileged. I work for a government employer. I get six weeks of vacation a year (not that I can really take them - as an academic your work waits for you if you don't do it so why bother?), and my healthcare is platinum. However, your mileage will vary.

In my case, I pay about 200$ a month for healthcare, which is 15% of the total and my employer picks up the other 85%. I have no deductible - meaning that I don't need to pay a certain amount out of pocket before the insurance kicks in. I also don't have co-insurance, meaning that I don't need to pay a percentage of the healthcare costs after paying the deductible. My out-of-pocket maximum is around 2000$ a year. 

This is the best healthcare available in the country, I believe. Everything is covered. Psychotherapy? 100% free. Drugs? 5$ a pop. Want to go to the walk-in clinic? I make an appointment on my phone and I'm seen an hour later. I want to see a specialist? I call a specialist my insurance covers and I make an appointment with them, and I see them when I want. I do have to pay a 30$ "co-pay" per visit, but that's really not a big deal. I'd spend more on takeout on the way back home. But that's not the typical experience. 

Generally, you will pay more a month (4-500$), you will have a deductible (\~1-2000$ per person), you will have co-insurance (\~40% of everything after that first 1-2000$), and higher out-of-pocket maximums (\~10 000$ per person). And if you leave or lose your job? No more healthcare. So you are tied to your job. 

In terms of work-life balance, yeah. In Canada, my experience is that physicists roughly count their hours. If they do annual on the weekend, they take a day off during the week. Or, they formally report it and get it as banked vacation time, or somesuch. Not so in the US. You're salary - they pay you a set amount, and you get the job done. It doesn't matter how late you stayed or if you came in the weekend, you still need to show up 5 days a week, 8 hours a day. 

The philosophy is very different too. Give you an example. At my Canadian clinic, we were trying to commission some new apperture in the TPS for cranial SRS. The machine in question we could only access during daylight hours once a week. It would treat until noon, we would need to setup the water tank for 1-2 hours, we would take 1-2 hours worth of measurements, and then we would stop so my colleagues could go pick up their kids from daycare. "Man, this is going to take six weeks to do, we waste so much time setting up that we can only take output factors for a couple field sizes before we have to tear it down". In the USA, we'd have set up the water tank on a friday, come in on the saturday and taken all the measurements, and commissioned the beam model within a week or two later.

There is a "get the job done" attitude in the US that doesn't exist in Canada, that makes it **very** different to come back. 

I'm happy to answer other questions.
	May I ask if you work for federal gov or state? Your healthcare coverage is friggin sweet.
@u/thephysicistisin
We are in desperate need of hiring if you're interested in hawaii 😊
I'd do way more research before uprooting yourself. A house in a decent area in NYC will be $1M+ usd. Toronto is a significantly cheaper city than NYC. If you move, to get ahead, you'd have to live in a more rural area.

The only perspective I can give you (from the us), is that where I work we don't really consider anyone internationally including Canadians. Too much for HR to handle lol.
	A house in Toronto is $1M+ CAD as well. 

But more interestingly, a house within a \~1-2 hour commute from Toronto is still largely >$1M+ CAD. But you can find much cheaper within a 2 hour drive from NYC.

You'd be surprised at how overpriced Ontario is.
Why not wait a few election cycles to see if the US will become some quasi authoritarian country first.  The Jan 6 insurrection attempt will just be the beginning of trouble if you look at the beer hall Putsch in Germany .  Hitler was let off light and look at what happened….
	The regime in charge now along with a large fraction of democrats are the true authoritarians.
Lol. All of the “if the Republicans …” bs. The OP is running away from socialist policies and the party with the socialists is the Democrat party, lol.
I am not a medical doctor but an academic who did the move from Canada to the US, and the salary difference is very similar to the one you mentioned (190k CAD to 250 USD). I live in the NYC Area. The cost of living difference absorbs most of the salary gain: childcare, schools and universities are more expensive. But the biggest issues that have not been mentioned: you restart from scratch in credit score (excellent credit score in Canada, no FICO score in the US for 2 years, makes buying a home impossible for 2 years), I lost a few levels of seniority and respect (even though paid more), when I had a team of researchers in Canada. The work atmosphere is much more tense (no common lunch or coffee break).  All in all, we're moving back pretty soon.
