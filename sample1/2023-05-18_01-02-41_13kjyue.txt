Post Title: Request for salary data
Post Content: Could someone please share the salary data a for non-certified therapy physicist with MS and 2-3 years of experience?

I am not able to access my AAPM account and they are currently closed for the day. I need this information rather urgently and any information shared will be much appreciated.  Thanks!

I'll point you to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalPhysics/comments/11rvmas/experienced_physicist_salary_question/). It has some comments from similar situations. Only 2021 salary data is out anyway so that's at least 2 years old.
	Thanks for sharing that post! The discussion seemed to be focused on physicists that are coming straight out of residency. I should have been more clear about what I meant by non-certified - looking for data on physicists that have not completed residency. The 2-3 years experience is clinical/industry.
		I can send you the PDF I have of the 2021 AAPM salary survey if you want? You could PM me your email.
			Yes, please!
