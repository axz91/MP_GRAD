Post Title: 2022 Survey of Medical Physics Student and Trainee Experiences
Post Content: Hi Everyone, [American Association of Physicists in Medicine](https://www.aapm.org/) (AAPM) and [Canadian Organization of Medical Physicists](https://comp-ocpm.ca/) (COMP) are collaborating to do a survey of Medical Physics Students and Trainee Experiences

The survey is open to all students and trainees in medical physics including MS, PhD, and DMP graduate students in medical physics, post docs working on medical physics research, certificate students in medical physics, and residents in medical physics programs.

It is a great opportunity to give anonymous and confidential feedback about your current training or education environment. The survey includes questions about demographics, financial support, mentorship, work-life balance, career development, diversity, inclusion, and harassment.

Your voice is important in guiding how COMP and AAPM can positively impact the experiences of students and trainees under the purview the respective organizations.

>open to all

Is that open to all people in Canada and the US who meet the criteria, or open to *all*?
	It is open to all, the hope is to report on a broad range of experiences. The focus however is indeed on trainees who are supported, mentored, or taught by members of COMP and AAPM. However, there are members of COMP and AAPM beyond just Canada and United States, so I encourage all trainees to complete it if they have time.
