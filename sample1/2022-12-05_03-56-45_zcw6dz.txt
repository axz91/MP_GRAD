Post Title: Considering a career in MRI physics
Post Content: Hello! I am currently working on my masters in health physics but I am going to be writing my thesis on imaging (namely CT). I recently heard of an area called clinical MRI physics where you can be certified by the ABHP for MRIs. I was wondering if anyone here knew anything about this career or how to get into it? I am very interested in MRIs and thought this seemed like an interesting field! 

Edit: Also worth mentioning that I have a bachelors degree in math and plan on getting a PhD after my masters to achieve this path. Thanks!
Comments: 
Clinical MRI Physicist positions (as well as industrial and academic) are often posted on the ISMRM job board: https://www.ismrm.org/career-center/ You can consult these and see what sort of background they require to fill a clinical position. 

However, I find that they're only about as common as NM physicist positions - which is to say not very common. The career path is also less structured and more ad-hoc. This may change as RT departments adopt MRI more and more into the TP workflow but no one knows for sure. If you're interested more in ML/CV applications in medical imaging, consult the MICCAI job board: http://www.miccai.org/job-board/

Hi I am trying to do the same thing, just passed Part 1 this year. It's not the ABHP, but the ABMP. Here is their website: [https://abmpexam.com/test-information/](https://abmpexam.com/test-information/)
	Yea my mistake! I meant to put that. I know the ABHP is for the CHP. Thanks! Did you find part 1 to be difficult?
		I procrastinated on studying so I felt unsure of a lot of things on the exam. It's all multiple choice though so process of elimination helped. I am in a medical physics MS so the the classes helped somewhat. Not sure how much overlap there is with a HP masters.
