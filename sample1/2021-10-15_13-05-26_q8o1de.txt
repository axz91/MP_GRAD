Post Title: AAPM Career Expo Oct 19th
Post Content: Reposting for those who might skip reading the Training Tuesday thread.

The AAPM Working Group for Non-Clinical Professionals (WGNC) and the Working Group to Promote Non-Clinical Career Paths for Medical Physicists (WGNCMP) are hosting a virtual non-clinical career expo on October 19, 2021 from 4:30-6 PM PT/7:30-9 PM ET. At this event, participants will be able to talk to professionals in a variety of non-clinical careers about their career paths, day-to-day responsibilities, or ask any questions they may have. Representatives from regulatory, academia, and industry will be present. This is not meant to be a job fair, but rather an opportunity to facilitate discussions about future career paths and roles that medical physicists fill outside of the clinic.

PM for the Zoom link or with any questions.
