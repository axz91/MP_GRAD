Post Title: Are there jobs for medical physicists in veterinary clinics?
Post Content: 
I'm still in college and I'm researching radiotherapy clinics in my city to do an internship, then I found a veterinarian one wich doesn't have a medical physicist working in it. Is it common?
I'm from a non technological country, so these types of therapies are really new, so I don't know if there's anything related to that.
Comments: 
I have managed two vet clinics as a consultant. It's alot of fun.
	Are the FTEs lower? I have gotten the sense they donâ€™t have the need for a full time physicist.
		No need for a full time physicist at all. The best physicists are neither heard or seen!

I'm not familiar with vet clinics but the discussion above may be of interest to you.
