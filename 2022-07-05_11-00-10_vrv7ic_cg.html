<h1>[Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 07/05/2022</h1>
<p>This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
<li>"How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Comment 1:</strong></p>
<p>Iâ€™ve recently gotten my bachelors in physics and am currently working full time as an engineering technician. The user wants to work for a year to save some money before applying to online MSMP programs that are available. The user has two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are online programs from accredited universities generally comparable to in person?</li>
<li>Would it be reasonable to be a student full-time while working a job?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Response 1:</strong></p>
<p>The responder personally does not advise for an online program unless the user's job is giving them significant clinical or research experience. The responder explains that while online programs may provide the same didactics, they can put the user at a disadvantage when it comes time to apply for residency. The responder mentions that match rates are typically low and that clinical readiness is a key factor for residency directors. The responder suggests supplementing online didactics with clinical shadowing and recommends contacting local physicists for assistance. As for working during the program, it depends on the specific program and its demands.</p>
<p><strong>Response 2:</strong></p>
<p>The user thanks the responder for the information and states that they will take it into consideration. The user asks if most grad students take loans to pay for tuition and use their work income for supporting themselves. The user also inquires if grad students get paid during their clinicals. The responder explains that getting paid for clinical work varies depending on the program, and the amount paid may not be enough to cover living expenses. The responder advises frugal living and potentially taking on a part-time job if the program permits and the user can manage their time well.</p>

<p><strong>Comment 2:</strong></p>
<p>The user is a Physics undergrad from Singapore entering their final/senior year. They express their interest in pursuing a career in Medical Physics but mention that no graduate programs are offered in Singapore for Medical Physics. The user asks for recommendations on universities in the UK or US to look out for and how to progress their career from there.</p>
<p><strong>Response 1:</strong></p>
<p>The responder provides a link to a list of CAMPEP accredited grad programs in the US. They mention that they are not sure where to look for the UK.</p>
<p><strong>Response 2:</strong></p>
<p>Another user suggests reaching out to medical or biology researchers who work with imaging, as they may find the user's physics and computational background valuable. They also mention that computational physics would provide transferable skills. The user is advised not to worry too much if they don't have medical physics experience in their undergrad.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Comment 3:</strong></p>
<p>The user asks for general advice for new residents, tips for making the residency more productive, and recommendations for taking/keeping notes.</p>
<p><strong>Response 1:</strong></p>
<p>The responder advises treating residency as a job and not overworking oneself. They suggest disconnecting outside of work and enjoying life. The responder also emphasizes the importance of putting in effort and taking every opportunity to learn from different people. As for note-taking, the responder used a paper notebook but wishes they had used a digital tool like OneNote for better organization and searchability.</p>
