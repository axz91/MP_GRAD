<h1>[Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 07/26/2022</h1>
<p>This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
<li>"How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is a yearly executive health exam part of your benefits package?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville. This is where I'm going</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does anyone has an idea how can international students join to medical physics job shadowing if it is out of their own school?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Just ask around, shadowing is not a paid job, or a job at all (should be a volunteer position) so it doesn't violates any USCIS law on international students work permits. If you get an outside your university job (actually paid and not just volunteer), make sure to get an CPT to stay legal. This is advice, make sure to clear everything with your school international advisors.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>so am little young but i must take the decision</p>
<p>I have some questions regarding this career,</p>
<p>firstly as a young person, will this career remain for like 20 to 40 years or it will be replaced by other alternatives, in other words, will it last forever?</p>
<p>second question, i really like this career however now i study the british curriculum (international ) and am kinda stuck at what to choose at A levels</p>
<p>i heard that it requires a good knowledge of math and physics thats why am going to be taking those, yet idk whether chem or bio are important or not</p>
<p>3rd question, ill be either at Australia or Canada so how is the career there?</p>
<p>finally is there a lot of demand on this career?</p>
<ol>

<li>
<p>thank u bro i really appreciate it, sorry for wasting ur time, i will study medical physics for sure as i extremely adore maths and physics and as i heard, the job opportunities are quite guaranteed, thanks again</p>

<p>Does anyone know of residency programs that are CAMPEP accredited but not participating in the match this year? Also any new programs joining this year for MS degrees?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I don’t have a complete list but maybe we can piece one together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To start:</p>
<p>MD Anderson</p>
<p>Vanderbilt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't believe there is a definitive list anywhere, but the programs not participating in the match normally post on the AAPM's career board and in the list-serve when they are actively seeking applicants. As for new residencies, check the places listed above, here (this subreddit - I think one posted semi recently), and the CAMPEP Accredited Residency page for when the entries are last updated.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>What consists of professional experience on the MP-RAP application? Does this include graduate research, awarded fellowships, or strictly industry-based professional experience? I can't seem to find an explanation of this anywhere.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The MP-RAP is very freeform. Put whatever you think is relevant (all the ones you listed would be fine), and the program director and interviewers will ask you questions as needed. Just be sure to keep your CV easy to read and highlighting your strengths. Every residency committee is going through tons of these applications and you need to make your strengths standout in the little time they’ll spend looking at it</p>

<p>I’ve been told that for many residences they are looking for someone that they want to work with, can trust to work independently and trust that they will ask questions when they do not know the material or are at the limit of their knowledge. Larger academic centers are also looking for residents that can contribute to ongoing research and make a niche for themselves.</p>
<p>You aren’t expected to have a vast clinical medical physics knowledge prior to residency, that is what the residency is for. It may be helpful, but certainly not required. Just being able to effectively communicate about your own research is important. During interviews, show an interest in wanting to learn clinical medical physics and you will get a long way. Ask a lot of good questions.</p>

<p>Does anyone have tips on interviewing for app specialist positions in industry? Going for one in a week, and am not quite sure what to expect.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Usually they want to see that you have customer service skills. Can you interpret a problem and communicate it to someone else at different levels. Are you able to train others on a product or new feature? Do you naturally want to learn applications in depth and understand them at a level most people won’t ever need to use?</p>
<p>In my experience, this is the kind of person they are looking for. It helps, but not required, to have experience with the application/product you are interviewing for. Most app specialists will have much more intense internal training to put you through that customers don’t have access to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for this! I'll keep these in mind (:</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are clinical physicists here using to find new job listings? LinkedIn, Indeed.com, AAPM, and/or just word-of-mouth?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All of the above. Word of mouth works best but it's not the only way. Join the listserv too. A lot of job postings on that.</p>

<li>
<p>I went through grad school applications last year (so take my opinion with a grain of salt because I am still new to the field) but when I applied to grad school and asked about residency acceptance odds, I was recommended to apply to Ucalgary, western, Uvic and UAlberta. I was told McGill is a great program as well but getting funding can be tougher.</p>
