<h1>[Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 09/27/2022</h1>
<p>This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
<li>"How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<h3>Comment 1:</h3>
<p>Hi! The user is a Canadian undergrad studying medical physics aiming to get into the medical physics field. However, their grades are quite average. They make up for this with research, having published one paper so far and working on a second, both related to oncology. They also do research in another health care field. The user is wondering if their amount of research could supplement for their average grades.</p>
<h4>Response 1:</h4>
<p>The response suggests that the user should make an effort to build a relationship with faculty in medical physics programs who they might work with as a graduate student. Having faculty advocate for them is the best way to get into grad school regardless of their grades.</p>
<h4>Response 2:</h4>
<p>The response states that having an average GPA should not be an issue for getting into a master's program. In fact, some clinical positions may prefer applicants with a master's degree due to their clinical work experience. The response advises the user to pursue a master's degree if they do not want to pursue a PhD.</p>
<h3>Comment 2:</h3>
<p>The user asks radiation therapy professionals how often they meet and talk to their patients, as they have been told that patient exposure varies widely between different hospitals and clinics.</p>
<h4>Response 1:</h4>
<p>A resident shares their experience, mentioning that their only patient interaction so far has been during certain treatments where they have to explain the procedure and introduce themselves.</p>
<h4>Response 2:</h4>
<p>Another response states that there is usually no direct interaction with patients unless they have specific questions. However, if a patient requests to speak to the physicist, they may have to answer various questions, ranging from simple ones that could have been answered by therapists or doctors to more technical inquiries. The response also mentions that some patients from related science fields may want to discuss the technical aspects of medical physics.</p>
<h4>Response 3:</h4>
<p>The response adds that medical physicists enjoy discussing their field with anyone interested in it.</p>
<h3>Comment 3:</h3>
<p>The user asks for information about residency programs that accept international students holding an F1 visa as OPT.</p>
<h4>Response 1:</h4>
<p>The response suggests checking the MP-RAP page of the residency programs as they sometimes disclose information about accepting international students. If the information is not available, the user is advised to email the program directors of the desired programs for clarification.</p>
<h3>Comment 4:</h3>
<p>The user asks if anyone has information about new CAMPEP residencies opening up in the next couple of years.</p>
<h4>Response 1:</h4>
<p>The response suggests looking at non-accredited residencies and checking if they are in the process of obtaining CAMPEP accreditation. The user is advised to contact the residency director for more information about the accreditation process and expected dates.</p>
<h3>Comment 5:</h3>
<p>The user, an astrophysics major, shares their concerns about not having research experience despite being in their third year. They mention that all available slots are taken or there is simply nothing available. The user plans to shadow a physicist at a nearby clinic to strengthen their grad school application.</p>
<h4>Response 1:</h4>
<p>The response shares a similar experience of having little research experience in undergrad but still getting into a medical physics program. The user suggests that getting clinical experience will be useful and shares their own journey of working as a medical physics assistant and getting into a specific program.</p>
<h4>Response 2:</h4>
<p>Another response mentions having similar issues with lack of research experience but still getting admissions to desired places. The user advises the original poster not to worry too much, especially if they are applying for a master's program.</p>
<h4>Response 3:</h4>
<p>The response suggests expanding the search for research opportunities beyond the physics department. They mention that research experience in other fields, such as biochemistry and biology, can also be valuable. The user advises finding a professor who is willing to mentor and collaborate.</p>
