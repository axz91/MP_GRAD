<h1>[Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 10/11/2022</h1>
<p>This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
<li>"How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments:</h2>

<p><strong>Comment 1:</strong></p>
<p>The user, who has a PhD in regular physics and has worked in academia and industry for about 6 years, is asking if it is still possible for them to get into medical physics. They are wondering if they can do a "postdoc" for a year or if they have to do 4 years of med school. They are also curious about the ABR test for certification.</p>
<p><strong>Response 1:</strong></p>
<p>The response explains that the user is mistaking medical physics training with physician training. They provide a link in the sidebar that explains the training pathways. They also mention that it is possible for someone with a non-medical physics PhD to enter medical physics through a graduate certificate program. They provide a link to a list of certificate programs and mention that some programs may be available online.</p>
<p><strong>Response 2:</strong></p>
<p>In response to the user's question about finding a residency, the response provides a link to a list of residency programs. They suggest applying widely for residencies and mention that having a PhD can be advantageous in some cases.</p>
<p><strong>Response 3:</strong></p>
<p>The response confirms that the user needs a 1-year didactic course for the graduate certificate. They suggest checking the same website as before for online schools offering the course. They also recommend familiarizing oneself with the Guide to a medical physics career link in the sidebar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comment 2:</strong></p>
<p>The user, an astrophysics major, is considering staying 1 extra quarter to get a bachelor's in math. They are concerned if this could potentially hurt their grad application if it gives the impression of being too focused on academia or a separate math-intensive field.</p>
<p><strong>Response 1:</strong></p>
<p>The response reassures the user that taking an extra semester for another major/minor would not be viewed negatively. They advise focusing on having good grades, strong Letters of Recommendation, some research experience, and expressing genuine interest in clinical physics in their personal statement.</p>
<p><strong>Response 2:</strong></p>
<p>The response mentions that the user had previously mentioned difficulties in finding research opportunities. They suggest considering applying to MS programs first and potentially applying for a PhD later. They emphasize the importance of demonstrating genuine interest in the field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comment 3:</strong></p>
<p>The user mentions having a master's in education and wonders if they should include it on their CV when applying for residency or if it would be a waste of space.</p>
<p><strong>Response 1:</strong></p>
<p>The response shares the personal experience of the user, who also had a master's in education before pursuing a career in medical physics. They mention that it was a helpful conversation point during interviews.</p>
<p><strong>Response 2:</strong></p>
<p>The response suggests that including the master's in education on the CV wouldn't hurt, as teaching and education are components of the job, especially in academic institutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comment 4:</strong></p>
<p>The user asks how to go about shadowing a medical physicist and if it is as simple as contacting a nearby oncology center.</p>
<p><strong>Response 1:</strong></p>
<p>The response suggests searching LinkedIn for medical physicists in the area and sending them messages expressing interest in shadowing. They also recommend checking the websites of hospitals or physics groups for contact information.</p>
<p><strong>Response 2:</strong></p>
<p>The response confirms that contacting a nearby oncology center and asking to speak to their physicist about shadowing is one way to go about it. They also suggest checking websites and reaching out via email.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comment 5:</strong></p>
<p>The user, an undergraduate senior, mentions getting a D+ in classical mechanics and asks if they can still get into a medical physics grad program. They also inquire about the importance of classical mechanics in medical physics and if there is a chance for them to get into an MS program.</p>
<p><strong>Response 1:</strong></p>
<p>The response shares a personal experience of the user who had failed some classes but still got accepted into their top three choices for medical physics programs. They emphasize the importance of demonstrating genuine interest in the field and finding ways to show more than just grades.</p>
<p><strong>Response 2:</strong></p>
<p>The response reassures the user that their overall GPA is more important than individual courses. They suggest considering retaking the class if the user is worried about it and wants to improve the grade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comment 6:</strong></p>
<p>The user asks if they can take Part 1 next year without going into residency and seeks clarification on the requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Response 1:</strong></p>
<p>The response provides a link to the requirements and application for Part 1 exam. They mention that there are multiple options available and only one is required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comment 7:</strong></p>
<p>The user asks if medical physicists wear white lab coats.</p>
<p><strong>Response 1:</strong></p>
<p>The response mentions wearing a lab coat during joint commission surveys and when discussing radiation dose with patients.</p>
<p><strong>Response 2:</strong></p>
<p>The response mentions wearing a lab coat for brachytherapy and when running around the hospital due to a lack of a brachy suite.</p>
<p><strong>Response 3:</strong></p>
<p>The response states that lab coats are issued at work but usually not required.</p>
<p><strong>Response 4:</strong></p>
<p>The response confirms that medical physicists can wear lab coats if they want to, but it is not usually required.</p>
