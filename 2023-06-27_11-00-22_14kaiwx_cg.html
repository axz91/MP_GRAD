<h1>[Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 06/27/2023</h1>
<p>This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
<li>"How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Comment 1:</strong></p>
<p>The user has a BSc in Computer Science and is interested in pursuing an MS in medical physics. They have taken the basic calculus-based physics sequence, as well as the math prerequisites for physics majors and an introduction to modern physics. They have no research experience.</p>
<p><strong>Response 1:</strong></p>
<p>The CAMPEP graduate standards state that an applicant with a non-physics major should have the equivalent of a minor in physics. This typically means taking at least three upper-level physics courses. To increase your likelihood of acceptance, you should consider taking upper-level physics courses offered through the physics department. Additionally, it would be beneficial to reach out to the graduate program directors at the programs you are interested in for personalized advice.</p>

<p><strong>Comment 2:</strong></p>
<p>The user is from South Korea and holds a bachelor's degree in Physics. They plan to apply and study in a CAMPEP-accredited medical physics graduate school in the US. They have two questions: 1) Can they take the ABR exams as an international student after graduating from a medical physics graduate school in the US? 2) Is it difficult to obtain a resident job in the US as a foreigner?</p>
<p><strong>Response 2:</strong></p>
<p>The ABR exams are open to international students, although the process may have some differences. As for obtaining a resident job in the US as a foreigner, it can be challenging due to the visa process. Many CAMPEP-accredited residencies prefer not to go through the process of supporting visas. However, academic centers are more likely to support and sponsor visas, although a PhD may be required for those positions. Opportunities may be more available outside of residency, where places are generally more willing to support foreign individuals as full staff members.</p>

<p><strong>Comment 3:</strong></p>
<p>The user has a BSc in Computer Science from a US university and is interested in getting into a CAMPEP medical physics program. They have taken the basic calculus-based physics sequences, math course prerequisites for physics majors, and an introduction to modern physics. They have no research or professional experience in physics. They are wondering if they have a competitive application and what steps to take next if not.</p>
<p><strong>Response 3:</strong></p>
<p>Having the basic physics background is a good start, but to have a competitive application for a CAMPEP medical physics program, it would be beneficial to gain research or professional experience in physics. Consider reaching out to professors or researchers in the field to explore opportunities for involvement in physics-related projects. Additionally, taking advanced physics courses and demonstrating a strong academic performance can further strengthen your application.</p>

<p><strong>Comment 4:</strong></p>
<p>The user is finishing their master's degree in Physics, specializing in medical physics. They study in Europe and are interested in clinical training. They have some queries regarding the next steps and inquire if they can reach out to someone based in Europe for clarification.</p>
<p><strong>Response 4:</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no specific information provided regarding someone based in Europe who can address the user's queries. It is recommended for the user to seek guidance from their academic advisors or professors who have expertise in medical physics and can provide the necessary information and clarification.</p>

<p><strong>Comment 5:</strong></p>
<p>The user has a lackluster undergraduate performance in physics but has a 4.0 GPA in their master's degree in AI and ML. They are considering pursuing a PhD in medical physics and wonder if it would be worth it. They believe their bachelor's degree may be more relevant despite the lower GPA.</p>
<p><strong>Response 5:</strong></p>
<p>Whether pursuing a PhD in medical physics is worth it depends on various factors. If the user is interested in a PhD that combines medical physics with AI and ML, there may be labs that would be interested in their background, especially if they have publications in the field. However, if their physics fundamentals are lacking, they may struggle to match with other types of labs. It is important to consider retaking classes to improve their physics knowledge and demonstrate a strong academic performance. Additionally, it may be beneficial to explain any factors that contributed to their lackluster undergraduate performance during interviews.</p>
