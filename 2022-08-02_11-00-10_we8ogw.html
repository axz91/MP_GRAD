<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 08/02/2022</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

><p>Constantly vigilant about safety: yes. Constantly worried about killing someone: no. These are not the same. I am not sure what you mean with your last question. Any job has stress and the risk of making a mistake. Safety protocols are good but of course they must be followed proactively and not just treated like a boring checklist to fill out.</p>
>><p>[deleted]</p>
>>><p>I'm afraid that learning what that responsibility feels like can only be experienced, rather than explained. But that's what residency is for, being given more responsibility in a gradual supervised manner.</p>
<p><b>Experience but no certification advice.

Supposedly one has a PHD in Biomedical Engineering, 10 years of experience in medical R&D, publications and a pretty good record in the academic/industry. If at this point one wants to change careers and become a medical physicist, is there a way to get accepted to a position without having done the residency? I assume not. If that’s the case, has anybody here done such a thing? Switch careers to go into med physics? Is it worth it all the effort and costs/ paycut to go through residency?</b></p>
><p>Without residency you can only be a physics assistant, which almost certainly be a huge pay cut for you. As for whether it is worth it to go through the whole certification pathway (certificate program, then residency, and also pass parts 1, 2, and 3) that is an entirely personal question. Why do you want to work in a clinic vs R&D? Why change career tracks when you presumably have a well paying one already? All things you should think about before starting.</p>
<p><b>Hey fellas, this might get buried but I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions to what to do in the upcoming weeks before I start the MS.

&#x200B;

Thank you!</b></p>
><p>As someone who just finished a year ago and is now starting residency, I heavily concur with u/kermathefrog. Your program is going to teach you everything you need to know, there's also going to be plenty of time to pursue review material once you know what you need to review for your specific program and circumstance. 

Going in fresh and relaxed will pay dividends en masse. The same advice applies even more for residency.</p>
><p>Relax. I'm serious, the first semester of my campep program was one of the most stressful of my life. Do a "you" day, go on a vacation, anything that you enjoy.</p>
<p><b>[deleted]</b></p>
><p>Yes! I’ve had a number of colleagues mwho did MRI research and move to therapy residencies. You’ll probably get a number of questions during residency interviews why you would be motivated to change directions. As long as you have your “why” figured out, it shouldn’t be a problem. Like what others said, be prepared to play catch-up if there are concepts you are not as well-versed in because of your experience.</p>
>><p>So I'm curious "why" did they change their field from MRI to Therapy?</p>
>>><p>They each had their own reasons, but in the end it didn’t matter (nor is it my place to say). Regardless they were also very smart to recognize that a lot of DI skills can translate well to therapy (especially with new IGRT strategies). So they spun a positive light on the switch, saying they provide a unique perspective. And it’s true!</p>
><p>You're never really locked into anything.  You'd have a lot of material to catch up on if you're going to switch though.  Be prepared to answer questions about why you're interested in switching during the residency interviews.</p>
><p>Not super common but not unheard of either. My chair switched fields for instance.</p>
<p><b>Is anyone aware of any programs offering an online option since COVID?</b></p>
><p>Georgia tech offers the only online CAMPEP accredited MS program.</p>
>><p>Super helpful! Thanks!</p>
<p><b>We've all seen the threads complaining about recent ABR exams. My question for recent Pt 1 takers is: what textbooks, if any, are good to base my review off of? I have all the classics, but I am not sure which ones are best for strictly ABR prep. Any of the 3rd party resources worth shelling out the money for in 2023? I am planning to take next Jan.</b></p>
><p>I got my hands on a bunch of Raphex exams too, some of the questions there are more clinically oriented but roughly the first 50 questions (or so) per exam are good part 1 review. Try to get imaging and therapy exams. And I also echo ABRPhysicsHelp, another decent one is oncology medical physics</p>
>><p>Cool thanks. Were these your only resources or did you go over textbooks as well?</p>
>>><p>Didn’t read textbooks word for word per se, but definitely went back and found some sections I needed to brush up on. Some concepts are better explained in research articles too, so don’t just limit yourself to textbooks, either. A google search of a particular subject/concept will produce helpful info. The more information you can find the better honestly</p>
>>>><p>Thanks again, I appreciate it!</p>
><p>Abrphysicshelp and we passed are what I used for part 1. Basically only those too. Passed first try</p>
>><p>Thank you!</p>
<p><b>I will be graduating a medical dosimetry program with a masters degree in the near future and was wondering what to expect salarywise nowadays. The AAMD gives a very low number from their 2019 salary survey compared to what all the self-reported websites say, which I assume is because the survey was taken almost 4 years ago. I left my job as a radiation therapist (making over 110k/year with less than 10 years experience) to enter this career and expected to make much more money being that the field is moving towards a master's requirement and I would be in the minority of CMD’s with this degree. Sorry for such a long question.</b></p>
><p>You were doing really good for a therapist and should be able to improve your salary with your new education. But you will likely not make the same salary starting, and it's going to take awhile to make up for the time differential (i.e. years of lost salary during your return to school). Hopefully money wasn't your primary driver for the transition.</p>
>><p>Thanks for the reply! Money was a big part of it honestly, along with the physical toll it put on my neck and back since I was one of the physically stronger male therapists, always called all over the department for lift help. I feel like many radiation therapists are significantly underpaid for the work they put in since they take on nursing and dosimetry responsibilities a lot of the time, as well as spending the most time with patients, and their families. Where I worked, the simulation therapists did a lot of dosimetry work also (I only know this now that I am interning at a different hospital as a dosimetrist). With that said I don’t regret my transition even if it means taking a bit  of a pay cut for a little bit. The mental and physical relief is definitely worth it.</p>

><p>You must attend accredited schools, CAMPEP is a requirement for board certification.</p>
><p>If you want to become ABR certified you have to to CAMPEP, or get a certificate if you do a non-CAMPEP PhD (I dont think you can do certificate for CAMPEP masters). In short, I would strongly advise to NOT do a Masters program that is not CAMPEP</p>
<p><b>I am starting my senior year of a Physics BS and I want to start applying for phd programs this fall for Medical Physics. I am looking for good text books I can start reading to learn more about the medical physics field as a whole.</b></p>
><p>Khan's Physics of Radiation Therapy is the standard text for therapeutic physicists; get the 4th or 5th* edition ...

Johns & Cunningham have a classic 1983 text as well, which is good also for diagnostic imaging physicists.

*I actually caught a typo they _introduced_ in this edition for one of the electron beam figures, making me wonder if they're now engaging in the make-a-new-edition-every-few-years-and-charge-300USD scam.</p>
><p>I wouldn't try to get ahead of the game by reading MP textbooks while doing grad apps. That material will come later. Just focus on your classes and applications, and remember to have fun with your last year of college. Savor it! You'll never be this age again, lol.</p>
>><p>Thanks for the advice! I am worried about my apps, would you have any advice on how to standout? I have research experience as well as TA experience and a decent gpa</p>
>>><p>best advice… Shadow, understand exactly what this field entails, to the point that you can speak somewhat about it during the interview. 

Most undergrads really don’t know much, which is fair considering how obscure it can be. The pdf I linked will help tremendously just by reading the table of contents. 

But shadow, and write a great personal statement on why you like this field, and not the generic, “well i like helping people, but also love my physics.”

Happy to reply/help more</p>

>><p>Thanks!</p>
><p>hmmm, Bushberg for Imaging physics is good and Khan for therapy, I would start there</p>

<p><b>For employed medical physicists here, is a yearly executive physical examination part of your benefits package?</b></p>
><p>Health insurance pays a good bit.

There's a yearly mandatory flu shot they declare is "optional" with documentation you must sign declaring reception of it to be 'voluntary', and HR sends out an email saying anyone who doesn't receive it will be terminated ...

It's so blatant it's almost funny: The form we must sign has a "Yes" checkbox for the volunteering-of-my-own-free-will statement, and no 'No' checkbox available...</p>
><p>You mean like a doctor's physical? I'd imagine any non self employed physicist has employer-sponsored health insurance that they can go see a doctor with.</p>
>><p>An executive physical exam is much more comprehensive and expensive than an annual exam and is given to employees who may wish to undergo such examination in order to treat any developing diseases that are without symptoms in the start so that they are not away from work for extended periods of time.</p>
>>><p>Yeah, that's not done at my institution -- though there is one that checks for a dozen or so common things. Not a comprehensive exam, though, just general screening, like a questionnaire + BMI measurement.</p>
>>><p>I've not heard of that, no.</p>
