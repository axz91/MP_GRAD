<h1>[Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 11/23/2021</h1>
<p>This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If the user is just learning about the field and wants to know if it is something they should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on their mind.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"The user can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
<li>"How does the user prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>

<p>The user was wondering, roughly, how many applicants on average does an Imaging residency program like UW, Duke... receive on a cycle?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All programs are supposed to publish their acceptance stats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Duke, for example: <a href="https://cipg.duhs.duke.edu/content/residency-statistics">https://cipg.duhs.duke.edu/content/residency-statistics</a></p>
<p>Does anyone know if anyone got accepted in UW-Madison without emailing a PI? Like, they just submit their application and they got an offer. Or is it necessary to email a potential PI?</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>The user is about to graduate with their undergrad in Biology and a minor in CS. They have taken physics 1 and 2 and calc but not all of the specific classes some schools "require" for admission. They are going to shadow a medical physicist this winter. If they like it, do they have any chance to get into grad school without taking those upper-level physics courses that some schools require?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can honestly succeed in a grad program and arguably do this job with a high school knowledge of chemistry and physics. I know plenty of people who satisfied the upper-level physics requirements while in a CAMPEP graduate program.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be clear, it's not saying it's likely, but it's also not saying it's even close to impossible. The academic world is a weird place and it's really only talking about 2-3 semesters of hard requirements when it's all said and done, with lots of room to pick up or have already picked up justifiable-enough credits for requirements like anatomy or an upper division *physical* chemistry class or the thermo taken as a biochem major. "A lot" in this instance meant like three or four and granted they were all usually a bit further along in undergrad physics than this user, normally having completed modern physics and no 300 levels. Granted, four people in a field this small is kind of a lot since it doesn't know close to everyone. They'd all done engineering or other things as undergrads. The people known were all PhD students working on MRI sequences or whatever who then got enticed by CAMPEP and found a way to make it happen. Some hated research and thought the clinic sounded rewarded, some wanted a backup plan in case that sacred tenure track job never materialized, some I'm sure had other reasons after discussing with the MP students they'd inevitably mingle with while researching PET reconstruction algorithms. "The rules" in grad school are somehow at the same time stubbornly immutable and totally flexible, so if the user is a known quantity to the CAMPEP faculty through course overlap or whatever it might not be too difficult to get themselves a CAMPEP certificate while only being semi-affiliated with the department. The schools they were at all had their didactic program aligned with imaging over therapy from what it's heard/can speak directly to and it assumes that's far more likely because imaging research casts a much broader net than therapy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you know any other careers or further schooling the user can do with just a biology major that incorporates CS somehow? They have grown to really like working with computers and have some basic coding knowledge but they couldn't just throw out all of the chemistry and upper-level bio courses so they stuck out their bio degree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's a GRE score required for a DMP program?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can only give input for masters programs. But the GRE wasn't really even considered outside the fact that it was a requirement to take it. If no one from DMP programs answers you, try reaching out to their grad school coordinators to help find the answer. There aren't many DMP programs and many would argue they may not even be worth it over a Masters & Residency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To add on to this, more and more PhD programs are dropping the GRE requirement entirely (and rightly so).</p>
