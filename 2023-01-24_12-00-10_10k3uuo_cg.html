<h1>[Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 01/24/2023</h1>
<p>This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
<li>"How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments:</h2>

<p>Does anyone have any recommendations for a comprehensive, mathematically rigorous text on MRI that's up a mathematician/physicist's alley? From the quantum mechanics to reconstruction.</p>
<p>Response 1: The ones they have in their collection are older books, so they are not sure how available they would be or if there's anything newer available.</p>
<p>Response 2: NMR Imaging in Biomedicine by Mansfield and Morris (1982) ISBN 0120255626</p>
<p>Response 3: NMR in Biomedicine: The Physical Basis (1989) ISBN 0883186039</p>
<p>Response 4: The second one is actually a collection of seminal papers related to NMR and MRI that was published by AIP and is good for getting a more historical look at the development of NMR/MRI</p>
<p>Response 5: There's also a Physics of MRI monograph from the 1992 AAPM Summer School (ISBN 1563962055). This one is likely harder to find and you'd probably have to find a fairly well established Medical Physics Department or diagnostic medical physicist to get your hands on a copy.</p>

<p>If you go to a campep accredited university for your masters, should you then go onto a campep accredited PhD program if you wanna continue to do research in the field?</p>
<p>Response 1: Many do, but it's not required for credentialing as the masters would take care of it.</p>

<p>Anyone got received an email for an interview in MD Anderson GSBS?</p>

<p>What's the best way to get an MP related internship as a first year Master's student? I've been looking around the internet and talking with faculty/mp's/medical physicist assistants in my area, seeing if anyone needs an intern for the summer, but I thought I'd ask here and see if anyone knows a trick to it.</p>
<p>Response 1: They asked their program director, clinical instructors, professors, and radiology department professors. They also asked their 2nd year classmates and PhD students. Most of the opportunities they had offered to them were research related, while others were just shadowing opportunities. They didn't find any that paid, but they got two really good letters of recommendations from the people they worked with. The resident at their school also let them know when they were planning on doing a machines annual test on a Saturday or Sunday. So they suggest to keep asking around.</p>

<p>Hello everyone! They are a physics student in Latin America. They are finishing their bachelor's degree and would like to do a master's degree in medical physics. They have European nationality, so they would like to emigrate to a European country. Some countries they have considered are Germany, Portugal, and Ireland. They are asking for opinions or experiences about studying a master's degree in medical physics in a European country. They also want to know which university is recommended and if medical physicists are well paid in different countries.</p>
<p>Response 1: They are in the US but they have a friend who went to Italy, to the ICTP the international Centre for Theoretical Physics. They liked it and all but had to go back to South America because he was on a government scholarship. It was a good program though, he did a residency at the end.</p>

<p>Hii !!</p>
<p>My wife has a PhD in pure physics. They are permanent residents of Canada. She is interested in applying for a CAMPEP accredited certificate program. She will be getting her provisional PhD degree on 27th January 2023. The last date for applying at the University of Calgary was 15th January 2023. They are not familiar with the university system of Canada. In India, there are almost nil chances to get admission after the last date. They are asking if there is any possibility if they request them and explain their position so that her application should be considered for the September intake.</p>
<p>Response 1: They suggest applying to Western University as they might consider her situation and base acceptance off PhD marks. The one-year MSc CAMPEP program at Western is a really great program. They encourage reaching out to the department for more questions.</p>
<p>Response 2: They are not sure about Calgary, but they suggest applying to Western University as they might consider her situation and base acceptance off PhD marks. The one-year MSc CAMPEP program at Western is a really great program. They encourage reaching out to the department for more questions.</p>
