<h1>[Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 06/07/2022</h1>
<p>This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
<li>"How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments:</h2>

<li>
<p>I'm seeing a lot of threads the last 2 days on new revolutionary pills that more accurately remove cancer, particularly rectum cancer. How will breakthroughs like this alter the field of medical physics?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it is good to be very skeptical of big claims and watch the evidence as it becomes published.</p>
