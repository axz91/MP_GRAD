<h1>[Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 01/25/2022</h1>
<p>This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
<li>"How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments:</h2>

<p>Review my shortlist.</p>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>So the user is from India and did undergrad in Physics from Calcutta University. They are currently doing data science from IIT Madras. They have a GPA of 3.3 and a TOEFL score of 110. They have founded a company in the ed-tech domain and have done projects like 3D brain image segmentation with DL. They have applied to Hofstra, Duke, Georgetown, and Purdue and are asking for feedback on their shortlist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is anyone here a current PhD student at duke and could answer some q’s I have abt the admission process? :)</p>
<p>The user is asking if there is anyone who is currently a PhD student at Duke and can answer their questions about the admission process.</p>

<p>About to graduate with my MS this semester, pretty sure I'm not matching for any residency programs, only got one interview out of all the places I applied to and I got ghosted for the second interview. How does post match work? Is it just sending emails once the matched/non-matched programs come around?</p>
<p>The user is about to graduate with their MS and is concerned about not matching for any residency programs. They are asking how the post-match process works and if it involves sending emails once the matched/non-matched programs are announced.</p>
<p>>Please crosspost to the residency sticky, thanks!</p>
<p>A response suggests the user to crosspost their question to the residency sticky thread.</p>

<p>Does anyone have opinions/experiences with UW Madison faculty or interviewing for their PhD program? I have five interview slots there on Friday and would like to see if anyone has any thoughts on them or know what to expect in their interviews</p>
<p>The user is asking for opinions and experiences with UW Madison faculty or interviewing for their PhD program. They have five interview slots at UW Madison and would like to know what to expect in the interviews.</p>
<p>>UW, like most places, will generally just be trying to see if you're a good fit. They'll ask you a lot of questions on your research (if applicable), so be ready to give succinct and clear answers. Other questions will be on your clinical background. Finally, there'll probably be some general knowledge testing. Like others have said, go in planning to interview them as well. Have questions ready about the rotation structure, machine and patient QA expectations, and...if we're talking about Madison, ask how much snow they've had.</p>
<p>A response provides some insights on what to expect in the interviews at UW Madison.</p>

<p>I currently just graduated with my B.S in physics. I have done two nuclear physics REU’s and am becoming more interested in health physics and possibly the medical physics field. The only thing is I really need a job before I were to continue school right now, due to financial issues. What kind of job should/could I be searching for based off only having a B.S?</p>
<p>The user has recently graduated with a B.S in physics and has done two nuclear physics REUs. They are interested in health physics and possibly the medical physics field but need a job before continuing their education due to financial issues. They are asking what kind of job they should be searching for with only a B.S degree.</p>
<p>>Working as a medical physics assistant pays average $45-50k based on a quick google search. This would get you in a department working with physicists and dosimetrists to see if you like the type of work they do. You'll be doing a lot of grunt work but you could make some valuable connections and references for down the line. I don't see a whole lot of these posted so I think its best to reach out to rad onc departments and see if they are looking or willing to hire an assistant.</p>
<p>A response suggests working as a medical physics assistant, which pays an average of $45-50k. They explain that this job would provide an opportunity to work with physicists and dosimetrists and make valuable connections and references.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That being said, I agree with u/Dosimetrist1 on just getting the debt over with while you are young. My student debt was terrible but I'm glad it was just one time. After I finished residency, I just continued living like a broke student (because $100k+ debt is broke anyway) until I paid them off. Didn't take too long and it was easy because I never had to lower my lifestyle to make payments. I just continued living like I always had!</p>
<p>A response agrees with the suggestion of getting rid of debt while young and shares their own experience of paying off student debt after residency.</p>

<p>Plus, if you were to start a program now, you are looking at 5-6 years minimum until you are board certified. I personally wouldn't want to put off that point in my career any longer than I would have to.</p>
<p>A response highlights the time commitment required to become board certified and suggests not putting off that point in one's career any longer than necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HAve you looked into data science?  A BSc with good undergrad data science experience would easily command a $80-100K starting pay ! Med phys training is way too long (5+ yrs with no guarantee of getting into residency etc)</p>
<p>A response suggests looking into data science as a career option, mentioning that a BSc with good undergrad data science experience can command a starting pay of $80-100K.</p>

<p>Q1. Residency applicants who submitted their applications in December of 2021, have you heard back from the programs you've applied to?</p>
<p>The user is asking if other residency applicants who submitted their applications in December 2021 have heard back from the programs they applied to.</p>
<p>I haven't received any reply yet. I think it might be due to one of the reference letters for my application being submitted only a few days ago.</p>
<p>Q2. Would it be proper to inform the individual programs that I've applied to, that my last letter has been submitted? I don't expect them to go back to reviewing if they have already past that stage. So I wonder if it would be worth it to let them know.</p>
<p>The user shares that they haven't received any replies yet and wonders if it would be appropriate to inform the programs that their last reference letter has been submitted.</p>
<p>>Hey I just want to give you a heads up that there is now a separate residency sticky and people should direct their questions related to residency to it.</p>
<p>A response informs the user about a separate residency sticky thread and suggests directing residency-related questions there.</p>
<p>>I’m from a program with a good match rate history (>80%) and, of the ~25 programs I applied to, I’ve only heard from 5 or 6, many just this week, with interview decisions. Some of my classmates got decisions weeks before I heard from them, so perhaps many programs are just informing applicants as they slowly roll through applications.</p>
<p>A response shares their experience of hearing back from only a few programs out of the many they applied to and suggests that programs may be informing applicants as they slowly review applications.</p>
<p>>I'm an average MS candidate from a CAMPEP program (50% match rate) and have had 1 interview invitation so far. My friend who is the top of the class has had 2 so far. Either we're all working at McDonalds or the match is taking longer this year than usual. You still have a shot.</p>
<p>A response shares their experience of receiving one interview invitation and mentions that the match process may be taking longer this year. They encourage the user by saying they still have a chance.</p>
<li>
<p>Q2: In my unqualified opinion, I would let them know. It shows initiative about fixing a mistake and that you aren't just lazy about getting 3 letters of recommendation or something. I would also imagine the letters of recommendation become more important after interviews anyway to decide between close candidates.</p>
<p>The user is asking for opinions on whether they should inform the programs they applied to about the submission of their last reference letter. A response suggests letting the programs know as it shows initiative and highlights the importance of letters of recommendation in the decision-making process.</p>

<p>Which masters and DMP programs typically get back Quickest?</p>
<p>The user is asking which masters and DMP programs typically have the quickest response times.</p>
<p>>Vanderbilt was the fastest master's program to get back to me. Didn't apply to UBC Vancouver, but they've also sent out interviews I believe. The PhD programs have been the quickest at sending interviews (at least for me)</p>
<p>A response mentions that Vanderbilt was the fastest master's program to respond and suggests that UBC Vancouver has also sent out interviews. They note that PhD programs have been quick in sending interview invitations.</p>
