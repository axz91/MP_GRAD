<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 02/21/2023</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

<p><b>Hi, so I’m currently a physics undergrad considering a career in medical physics. I recently left my research lab in optical physics since I really did not enjoy it at all. I only worked in this lab for a few months (no publications). Assuming this would be the only experience-besides my senior thesis-that I would have when I graduate, how much of a hinderance would a lack of undergraduate research be for medphys admissions? I have no intention of pursuing a research career and definitely more interested in the clinical side. 

I’m also concerned about the chances of residency. After looking at stats, programs seem to only accept 1-2 people out of tens of applicants. My school offers a DMP. Would this be a safer and more worthwhile path? How about compared to just a masters?</b></p>
><p>It definitely depends on the graduate school, but many MS students successfully obtain a residency (many schools have a 100% historical match rate with MS students, even).  A quality thesis project on top of academic success can go a long way. Fitting in extra clinical experience during your MS is often helpful as well. From my understanding, DMP programs are being phased out. If you are able to get into a strong graduate program (definitely CAMPEP accredited), I would recommend MS to residency over DMP, simply from a financial standpoint.</p>
><p>I can not answer your second question as I am not an American based physicist (though last I can recall DMP were being somewhat phased out), but I can say not having publications as an undergraduate should not be a hindrance, and in fact is the norm for undergraduates entering grad school.</p>
<p><b>Hi..

Can i apply for CAMPEP accredited graduate or certificate program now that i've completed my master's in medical physics in India ? If not please do tell my options to further study in abroad except Phd.</b></p>
><p>CAMPEP certificate programs are exclusively for PhD holders from Physics or closely related fields. You’ll need to look at doing a second MS from a CAMPEP medical physics program.</p>
><p>Certificate CAMPEP programs are only for people who have a PhD in science or engineering. You very likely can apply to CAMPEP graduate programs. Assuming you’ve had calculus and physics (e.g., classical mechanics, E&M, quantum mechanics, or similar). Usually if American students are missing a class, it’s two semesters of college chemistry and one of anatomy & physiology - I’m guessing you’ve had those. If you can arrange to shadow a medical physicist, that might look good on your application.</p>
<p><b>What are Medical physics assistant usually doing in the clinic, are they perform Machine QA, Treatment planning, Brachytherapy, and PSQA, or just some of assign works? What do I need to get MPA jobs, do I MS medical physics or I just need BS physics
Thank you</b></p>
><p>They usually fall into one of two groups.

1. BS in science/engineering, and is a great job to get your feet wet and see if medical physics is for you. (I did this for a couple years before going into a CAMPEP MP program)
2. MS in Medical Physics, but did not get into residency. They usually stay in this job until they eventually match.

For the work, it depends on the clinic's needs, the employee's background, and how comfortable the staff is with the MPA. It can range from: Daily/Monthly QA, patient QA, helping physicists with projects and research, helping the physicist with annual QA or commissioning, independent projects, procedure writing, organizing spreadsheets and data, migrating data between systems, re-organizing storage rooms, cleaning up block rooms, scripting and/or programming to help automate tasks or visualize data. Basically... stuff physicists may be too busy to do themselves.</p>
><p>A BS in a physical science/engineering is generally all that is required for mpas.</p>
<p><b>Hi all!  I'm an internation student, senior undergrad in physics applying to medical physics masters programs. I just received two rejection letters and haven't heard back from any of the other schools (complete silence, no interviews). So I'm wondering if I didn't get into any programs, what can I do over the next year to better prepare myself and reapply? 

  
I am thinking about applying to introductory jobs in the industry (companies like Varian, Elekta, etc) as it is hard to find a job in the hospitals for physics bachelors. Any suggestions or tips would be greatly appreciated!</b></p>
><p>It is possible you might be able to find a medical physicist assistant job. Working for vendors / manufacturers should be good. If you can shadow a medical physicist, you might be able to include specifics in your application letter. I assume you’ve already researched to make sure the schools you’re applying to accept international students, and that whatever prerequisite courses they require, you’ve had them.</p>
>><p>Thanks for the reply!

I attended U.S. college for all four years of undergrad, so prereqs are pretty much fullfilled. I did shadowed a medical physicist at our university hospital last year. It was a one time experience but enough for me to confirm I want to pursue MedPhys and put it in my SOP. 

Getting a medical physics assistant job is definitely something I will look into. Again, thank you for the advice!</p>
