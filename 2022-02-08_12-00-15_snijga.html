<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 02/08/2022</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

<p><b>Hey does anyone have any personal experience with Rhode Island’s Masters program? I was just accepted and was looking for a better picture so that I could begin trying to make a decision. Currently I am undecided between VCU and URI.</b></p>

><p>It depends on what details you go into, to be honest. I think, typically, its best to cover a summary of your education and path to where you are but also let them know a little bit about you as a person. Use some common sense though and try to keep it interesting and about things to make you look good. Getting too personal or bringing up weird topics could end up hurting you.</p>
<p><b>Did anyone receive interview invitation to duke?</b></p>
><p>for diagnostic residency interview, they already sent all the invites</p>
>><p>Same for therapy residency</p>
><p>For their graduate program, Duke held interviews yesterday and have another session today</p>

>>>>>>><p>The venn diagram of what the job looks like between an MD and an MP are basically two separate circles. It’s not like the difference between a nurse and a physician where there’s a ton of overlap in what they could do and the physician’s circle is much larger. We do entirely different things and just happen to work in the same clinic as a radiation oncologist or radiologist. For people that don’t know what an MP does, your question is very typical but it’s very confusing to a lot of people that do know what an MP does. It’s like asking a lawyer why they didn’t become an engineer. Idk, not for me lol.

Additionally, many MDs are actually paid near what a MP Is paid (.75 to 1.5X) unless you are in a more lucrative subspecialty or one of the work-life balance killers, and there is absolutely nothing guaranteeing you will land one of those unless you end up in an upper quartile of your medical school program. Medical physics I think pound for pound/hour for hour/stress for stress comes out potentially ahead of a physician in a ton of cases. Here’s hoping to another four decades of this so I can retire happy.</p>

<p><b>What will be the most important component for clinical medical physics for MS graduate students besides Machine Quality Assurance and Treatment Planning?</b></p>
><p>Machine commissioning</p>
<p><b>Hi, I'm an international student currently finishing up my Masters in Astrophysics in Germany. I'm  thinking of pursuing a career in Medical Physics, but I'm not sure how to proceed , as in which program should I apply for (Masters or PhD in Medical Physics) ? Is having a masters in Astrophysics going to put me in a disadvantage when applying for a Masters/Phd in Medical Physics? Thank you!</b></p>
><p>Re: GRE, I believe many of the top programs like UWMadison, UCLA, UChicago, aren't requiring GREs anymore (and I know UChicago and UWMadison aren't even accepting them). Also having a masters in Astro will not in any way put you in a disadvantage when applying. It shows experience in grad level physics. And any prior research from undergrad or grad would also definitely be an advantage in an app!</p>

>><p>Hi, thanks for replying. Yes I'm interested in working in North America and I think I would prefer to pursue a PhD in Medical Physics, as I would like to keep the option of doing research in this field open, as opposed to the Masters which limits me to only doing clinical work. 

Are the PhD programs fully funded? and do you have any universities that you would recommend to apply for the PhD program?</p>
>>><p>I just want to add that lots of MS physicist do research too, it just depends on your center's goals (eg academic vs community) and your own motivation.</p>
<p><b>any common questions for graduate school interviews? Never done an actual interview so i’m slightly nervous on a question asked that i have no idea on how to answer</b></p>
><p>I think I had some light questions to see if I had looked into the science at all - like what effect does radiation have on biology?  Then the rest were like to talk about a project or problem you had in school/work.  Later on as a student participating in the next year’s class’ recruitment, we heard that by the time of interview, they’re looking for more of a personality fit since the program is quite hands-on and collegial.</p>
>><p>They definitely are mostly a fit thing.  I did have some questions about some modern physics like photoelectric effect and Compton but I think that was just to see if I was familiar with the concepts. > 95% of it was just talking about me and my interests and projects I worked on.</p>
><p>I'd also suggest emphasizing why you want to go to XYZ program. Know specifics about the university, the program, the city, the professors etc. and be able to mention and show why you think this program would be good for you (i.e. not only why you are good enough for the program). Grad school interviews are a strange mix of both an interview and a recruitment. You want them, but they also want to make sure that you want them!</p>
<p><b>Anyone can provide the residency opportunities for master students except for COMP website? Thank you!</b></p>
><p>CAMPEP website lays out all residencies and gives links to their website. If you are looking for residencies to start this July 2022 you are late, no more places to apply now. But its good to prepare for next year cycle.

Ps.: The individual program website says if they only take phD students or Ms as well. MP-RAP also has that data available when you are applying.</p>
>><p>Plenty of places say they only take PhDs but also only have MS in the program.</p>
<p><b>Anyone have information on Brown University's graduate program?</b></p>
><p>Some of their faculty are pretty well known amongst the Medical Physics community so that will be a plus going forward.</p>
><p>What kind of information? It is brand new so they probably don't have anyone to talk about the program experience.</p>
