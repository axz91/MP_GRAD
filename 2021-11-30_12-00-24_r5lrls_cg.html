<h1>[Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 11/30/2021</h1>
<p>This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
<li>"How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<h3>Comment 1:</h3>
<p>The user is currently a radiologic technologist with a B.S. and interested in a masters program for diagnostic medical physicist. The user is having a hard time finding a program specifically for diagnostic and asks for advice, specifically mentioning Arizona.</p>
<p>Response 1: There are not specific programs for diagnostic or therapy, you will learn about both in any CAMPEP program. That being said, some are better than others about their imaging curriculum. I would recommend looking at the course catalog and seeing if there are a decent number of imaging courses, especially advanced electives. Match rate is important too.</p>
<p>Response 2: Thanks! I just assumed there were different pathways for diagnostic vs therapeutic. No wonder I was having trouble.</p>
<p>Response 3: The paths diverge at the residency stage; you will have to pick what track you want to do, then apply (and hopefully match) to a residency in that track. Part 2 and 3 of the ABR exam are also track specific. So keep that in mind as you progress through your career.</p>
<h3>Comment 2:</h3>
<p>The user has a bachelor's in physics and a masters in data science. They have worked as a pharmaceutical chemist/engineer and are currently in aerospace. They express a desire to do something that can help people and asks for advice on where to start or what programs to look into for working in oncology or a hospital setting.</p>
<p>Response 1: [deleted]</p>
<p>Response 2: Thank you for the response. I work next to a hospital in Boulder and found a person on LinkedIn that I'll reach out to and see if I can do some shadowing.</p>
<p>Response 3: [deleted]</p>
<p>Response 4: Yeah I don't use it much either I just didn't want to sound like I wasn't willing to try. He's got an (apparently) common name so a lot pops up so if I don't find something by the end of the weekend I'll use LinkedIn. Thanks for the heads up.</p>
<h3>Comment 3:</h3>
<p>The user is currently doing an undergrad in Astronomy and wants to major in Physics/Medical Physics in their masters. They ask if this is directly possible and if any bridge courses are needed. They also inquire about recommendations for masters courses in the EU.</p>
<p>Response 1: Are you taking other physics courses like E&M, QM, Circuits, Modern Physics? If so, you won't need any bridge courses except maybe some Anatomy/Physiology. Just check out the prerequisites for the Master's programs you're interested in applying to. If their websites don't show it email their admins.</p>
<h3>Comment 4:</h3>
<p>The user asks for advice on what stands out the most in residency applications and if there is anything in particular that reviewers look for. They also inquire about what should be included in the personal statement.</p>
<p>Response 1: There are lots of negatives. The good applications all start to bleed together. Have good grades, has some experience using the equipment we use, isn't too short, isn't too long, good letters of recommendation, a legible personal statement.</p>
<p>Response 2: A personal statement can be anything. Most people write about something they overcame and that's why they chose medical physics, or someone they loved has/had cancer and that's when they wanted to work in Radiation Oncology. Those are all good and there is nothing wrong with them. Like I said they just all bleed together. But that's not a bad thing. Your application should get you your interview, and that's where you can show your personality/work ethic/etc.</p>
<h3>Comment 5:</h3>
<p>The user asks if it is okay to apply to residencies that are not CAMPEP accredited.</p>
<p>Response 1: If your end goal is to work as a clinical physicist then it is risky. Programs need residents to become accredited so newer programs will need to recruit people to be first through the program. I would ask specific questions about where they are at in the accreditation process, when their site review dates are scheduled, or when they anticipate having those scheduled for. Make sure they have a full curriculum planned for their residents. Once you get this information, verify their progress toward accreditation with CAMPEP. You can get all the requirements and documents from CAMPEP of what they require programs to provide to complete this process to gauge where they currently are.</p>
<p>Response 2: I would only apply to a program that has done most of this work upfront and has dates scheduled or are applying for site review in the near future (no more than a year out would be safe to give time to address deficiencies.) Do not apply to a program that is just looking for cheap resident labor. CAMPEP requires they have a set program with rotations and education on top of clinic work. They should allow you time to read reports, do journal presentations, and learn required information during each rotation along with regular examinations. Anyone that just wants you doing QA for 12 hours a day probably won't pass an accreditation review.</p>
<p>Response 3: Again, this is risky but not terrible if they have done a lot of work up front. As long as they complete accreditation while you are a resident, you will be board eligible.</p>
<h3>Comment 6:</h3>
<p>The user asks if subpar GRE scores should be sent to masters programs that do not require them.</p>
<p>Response 1: Only if you are okay not to have a path to ABR certification.</p>
<p>[deleted]</p>
<p>Response 2: I would say, first you need positive references. Good physics resident recommendation is better than bad professor recommendation or even excellent recommendation from former employer (who has no idea what is medical physics and recommend you in general).</p>
