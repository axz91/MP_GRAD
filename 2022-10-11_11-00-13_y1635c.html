<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 10/11/2022</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

<p><b>I have a PhD in regular physics and have worked in academia and industry for about 6 years. Is it still possible for me to get into medical physics? Is it just a question of finding a place that will allow me to do a "postdoc" for a year? or do I have to do 4 years of med school? Im guessing this isnt something that can be just done online. It sounds like at some point id also take an ABR test to become certified?   


any advice/resources would be appreciated.</b></p>
><p>You're mistaking medical physics training with physician training. Here is a link in the sidebar that explains the training pathways: [http://www.sdampp.org/documents/SDAMPPStudentGuideToAMedicalPhysicsCareer.pdf](http://www.sdampp.org/documents/SDAMPPStudentGuideToAMedicalPhysicsCareer.pdf).

To answer you question, yes you can enter medical physics if you have a non-medical physics PhD, you can do a graduate certificate program, which will basically encompass just the didactic portion of a CAMPEP master's program. Certificate programs are listed here: [https://www.campep.org/campeplstcert.asp](https://www.campep.org/campeplstcert.asp). I personally know of one person who did the UCLA certificate online while working in a different state, and they are a first year resident at a therapy program now. I do not know about other online options; check the websites for more information.</p>
>><p>thanks! is it hard to find a residency? I live next to a mid-sized city</p>
>>><p>The list of residency programs is here: [https://www.campep.org/campeplstres.asp](https://www.campep.org/campeplstres.asp). Consensus seems to be that it is good to apply widely for residencies, so you will probably need to move for residency. Having a PhD helps because several are PhD only and PhD holders can have an edge on MS holders in some cases.</p>
>>>><p>So it looks like what I currently need is a 1 year didactic course for the graduate certificate. Unfortunately whenever I google that, I end up at 4-6 year universities. Any idea where I can find an online school for this material?</p>
>>>>><p>[https://www.campep.org/campeplstcert.asp](https://www.campep.org/campeplstcert.asp) Same website as before. Some certificate programs might be online, just check their websites. If you're seriously considering this field get acquainted everything in the Guide to a medical physics career link in the sidebar.</p>
<p><b>Astrophysics major here, considering staying 1 extra quarter to get a bachelors in math as well, as anyone done something similar? Could it potentially hurt my grad application if they think I’m too focused on something in academia or a separate more math-intensive field altogether?  (For reference, I’m extremely interested in the MP field and would want to do clinical)</b></p>
><p>I think you're overthinking this. I don't think that it would be viewed negatively to take an extra semester for another major/minor (I did the same for a bio minor). But it also won't make or break your application either. Have good grades, strong LoRs, maybe a bit of research, and in your personal statement speak intelligently about why you want to be a clinical physicist and I think you'll do fine.</p>
>><p>Thanks for the response! We’ve actually chatted before, and unfortunately I’m the guy who mentioned before that he couldn’t find any research opportunities for whatever reason (frustrating, but everyone around me is scrounging for positions so lots are in the same boat), and my only real idea now is to simply shadow a MP, but other than that I don’t really know what to do to strengthen a potential phd application (at this point I’m starting to think I should apply to MS only and *maybe* apply for PhD after the fact, since Ms is less competitive and I’m still starving for research).</p>
>>><p>I'm sorry to hear that you're having a hard time finding research opportunities. This has been discussed in the subreddit before but generally opinion regarding a PhD is to only do it if you really want the PhD itself and to have a shot at a faculty position later on, and not just to increase your chances at the match. Still, my above advice applies to both MS and PhD applications alike.</p>
<p><b>I was a high school teacher (AP Calc & AP Physics) between undergrad and deciding to go to grad school. Do you think my master’s in education is something I should put on my CV when applying for residency or is it just wasting space?</b></p>
><p>I actually did the same thing, MEd —> high school physics teacher —> MS medical physics —> med phys match. 
It was a helpful conversation point and was only a positive during all my interviews.</p>
>><p>Oh wow. There’s hope for me yet!</p>
><p>Probably wouldn't hurt.  One component of the job is teaching and education, especially if you end up at an academic institution</p>
<p><b>How do I go about shadowing a MP? Is it as simple as calling the nearby oncology center and asking to speak to their physicist about shadowing at some point?</b></p>
><p>I searched LinkedIn for medical physicists in my area and cold messaged some. Introduced myself and explained that I was interested in finding shadowing opportunities. I was able to find one physicist to shadow that way and had a handful of fruitful conversations with others. That's another route you could pursue.</p>
><p>That is one way. You also may look on their website to see if it lists their faculty and send them an email. Or you could see if there are any local physics groups independent of a specific hospital that you can call or email.</p>
<p><b>Undergrad senior here, I got a D+ in classical mechanics. Can I still get into a medical physics grad program?  
My school doesn't allow grade replacements, but I can take the class over if I want. My overall GPA is still pretty decent (3.5), and I have some research experience in cosmology. Does CM even have a huge role in MP?   
Is there still a chance for me to get into a MS program? Thanks.</b></p>
><p>While my experience is unique to me and should be taken a grain of salt:

I *failed* a few classes (partial DEs, differential geometry, a semester of E&M that I eventually retook and got an A in, quite a few others Cs; my overall GPA was a 3.33ish) and was still accepted into my top three choices. Mind you, I supplemented in many other ways. I was a non-traditional applicant who spent over a year in finance, I had about a years experience in solidstate physics research (despite my interest in cosmology) with no publications but my work helped get the lab funding for a future position, I had shadowed a local physicist to get an idea of the career (which showed interest and that I knew more about the career than "we make decent money"). I'm also latino and I'm sure that likely played a role. I also interview somewhat well (not amazing). Hell, I eventually even matched. 

Point is, you absolutely have a chance, but you should absolutely find ways to show you're more than your grades. Also, even if you didn't have a GPA issue, find concrete ways to demonstrate genuine interest in the field. We are literally responsible for the safety and effective delivery of life-saving treatment of patients. Program directors want to make sure you know that you're genuinely interested in this and going to be a safe and grounded physicist, for the sake of future patients.

Also, no, cosmology doesn't play much of a role at all. There are aspects of what you learn in cosmology that *might* be useful as tools, but that's few and far in between and they certainly aren't vital.</p>
>><p>Thank you for this reply. Gives me some hope! I think I will spend some time shadowing a MP, or at least doing something physics-related, to show I'm more than some grades.

Also, sorry for the confusion, by CM I meant classical mechanics (the class I semi failed). Would admissions teams care a ton about this class? I'd imagine they would care more about classes like EM, optics, modern physics?</p>
>>><p>It's hard to say since I've never seen the admissions process from the inside. However, I will say that one of the classes I got a C in was actually the second semester of classical mechanics sooo :). 

Ultimately, this field isn't hyper-focused on in-depth physics once you're passed a certain point. The intuition you gain from that knowledge is absolutely useful because we're applying those concepts, but I can't even remember the last time I solved any CM/QM/EM problem.</p>
><p>You're probably okay as the GPA is more what people will focus on instead of the individual courses. But if you are even slightly worried about it, and it's available, you could try taking it again so if you're asked about it on your interviews you can mention how you are trying to improve the grade.</p>
<p><b>Can you take Part1 next year without going into residency? I have seen having enrolled in a Residency as a requirement. Can someone clear this out?</b></p>
><p>https://www.theabr.org/medical-physics/initial-certification/part-1-exam/requirements-application</p>
>><p>Looks like that is one of 5 options you can use, but either of the other 4 will suffice. You only need one.</p>
<p><b>Do medical physicists get to where the white lab coats?</b></p>
><p>I wear mine when the joint commission surveyors are here and occasionally when I talk to patients to discuss their radiation dose.</p>
><p>I do for brachy when I'm running around the hospital due to a lack of a brachy suite.</p>
><p>We were all issued one at work</p>
><p>If they want to, sure.  Usually not required</p>
