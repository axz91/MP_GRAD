Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 10/18/2022

Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If the user is just learning about the field and wants to know if it is something they should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on their mind.

Examples:

- "The user majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for them?"
- "The user can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
- "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
- "Masters vs. PhD"
- "How does the user prepare for Residency interviews?"

Comment 1:
Is it okay for the user to do a residency first and then apply for a PhD after? And during the residency, will they be knowledgeable in doing the ABR tests?

Response 1:
The user can do a residency then a PhD, but most individuals don't. Residency is all about preparing them for ABR part II and III, more so than a PhD, which focuses more on research than clinical medical physics. Additionally, with a MS and Residency, the user can enter the workforce making 120-150k per year even without ABR certification. However, it is recommended to be on track to obtain the certification. Leaving a stable and high-paying job to pursue a 4-year PhD, where the salary is around 30k per year, may not be the most "smart" decision. A PhD is beneficial for increasing the chances of getting a residency and working as a professor in academic institutions, but it won't necessarily make the user more knowledgeable in ABR tests and won't significantly increase their salary.

Comment 2:
What does the user need to become a medical physics assistant in the US? Do they need to have an MS degree from CAMPEP, or would a BS in physics be enough for this position?

Response 2:
The requirements for a medical physics assistant position vary depending on the specific job. In some cases, a BS in physics can be sufficient.

Comment 3:
The user is applying to residency soon. Does the "reputation" of a residency name brand matter? They have considered reputation when applying to college and grad school, but they are unsure if it is important in picking a residency. If reputation does matter, how can they determine which residencies have strong "name brands" in the field?

Response 3:
The response to this comment has been deleted.

Response 4:
At the end of the day, finding a good fit for the user is as important as obtaining a residency position. Coming from a CAMPEP accredited residency will generally be sufficient for obtaining a job, so the user shouldn't worry too much about program reputation. Each program has its strengths and weaknesses, which the user will come to learn during interviews. It is important for the user to focus on what they want out of their residency training and what would be a good fit for them.

Comment 4:
How optimistic are physicists about the career field moving forward? With vaccines and other methods becoming better and better, is there still a positive outlook on the necessity of radiation therapy in 10 years?

Response 5:
Medical physicists will still be needed in the future, not just in radiation therapy but also in imaging. Vaccines are unlikely to have a significant impact on the field of medical physics. While there are advancements in vaccines and other methods, there will still be a considerable amount of cancer to treat. Quality imaging is critical before, during, and after cancer treatment, so the field of medical physics will continue to be important. The demand for medical physicists may even increase, as seen by the growth in the physics team at the commenter's current job.

Comment 5:
The user is interested in radiation therapy and wonders why successful vaccines wouldn't have a significant effect on the field of physicists. They want to understand if vaccines and radiation are used in different scenarios that are virtually independent of each other.

Response 6:
Radiation therapy is primarily used to treat cancer, and there will continue to be a significant need for it in the future. While vaccines, such as the HPV vaccine, can prevent certain types of cancer, there is still a long way to go before medical physicists are no longer needed. The commenter also mentions the importance of imaging in cancer treatment and advises not to overlook its significance. Radiation therapy is applied in a way that delivers a high dose to the tumor while minimizing the dose to the rest of the body, specifically organs at risk.

Comment 6:
The user is currently applying to PhD programs and is nervous about the low acceptance rates. They have a CAMPEP accredited MS degree and have done a thesis. They previously applied to PhD programs after obtaining their physics BS but were rejected from all of them. They want to know if PhD programs prefer MS applicants over BS applicants and if their MS thesis will help. They also ask for any other suggestions to increase their chances of getting accepted.

Response 7:
The commenter is unsure about the specific chances of being accepted with a master's degree. However, if they don't get accepted this year, they have other options such as going into the Match and looking for a residency. They can pursue a PhD after completing the residency. It is noted that some PhD programs may not notify applicants until after the Match is decided.
