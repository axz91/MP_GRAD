<h1>[Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 02/08/2022</h1>
<p>This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
<li>"How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments:</h2>

<p>Hey does anyone have any personal experience with Rhode Island’s Masters program? The user was just accepted and was looking for a better picture so that they could begin trying to make a decision. Currently, the user is undecided between VCU and URI.</p>

<p>It depends on what details the user goes into, to be honest. The user thinks, typically, it's best to cover a summary of their education and path to where they are but also let them know a little bit about them as a person. They should use some common sense though and try to keep it interesting and about things to make them look good. Getting too personal or bringing up weird topics could end up hurting them.</p>

<p>Did anyone receive an interview invitation to Duke?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For diagnostic residency interview, they already sent all the invites</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Same for therapy residency</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For their graduate program, Duke held interviews yesterday and have another session today</p>

<p>The venn diagram of what the job looks like between an MD and an MP are basically two separate circles. It’s not like the difference between a nurse and a physician where there’s a ton of overlap in what they could do and the physician’s circle is much larger. They do entirely different things and just happen to work in the same clinic as a radiation oncologist or radiologist. For people that don’t know what an MP does, the user's question is very typical but it’s very confusing to a lot of people that do know what an MP does. It’s like asking a lawyer why they didn’t become an engineer. Idk, not for me lol.</p>
<p>Additionally, many MDs are actually paid near what an MP Is paid (.75 to 1.5X) unless they are in a more lucrative subspecialty or one of the work-life balance killers, and there is absolutely nothing guaranteeing they will land one of those unless they end up in an upper quartile of their medical school program. Medical physics the user thinks pound for pound/hour for hour/stress for stress comes out potentially ahead of a physician in a ton of cases. Here’s hoping to another four decades of this so the user can retire happy.</p>

<p>What will be the most important component for clinical medical physics for MS graduate students besides Machine Quality Assurance and Treatment Planning?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Machine commissioning</p>

<p>Hi, the user is an international student currently finishing up their Masters in Astrophysics in Germany. They are thinking of pursuing a career in Medical Physics, but they're not sure how to proceed, as in which program should they apply for (Masters or PhD in Medical Physics)? Is having a masters in Astrophysics going to put them at a disadvantage when applying for a Masters/Phd in Medical Physics? Thank you!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Re: GRE, the user believes many of the top programs like UWMadison, UCLA, UChicago, aren't requiring GREs anymore (and they know UChicago and UWMadison aren't even accepting them). Also having a masters in Astro will not in any way put them at a disadvantage when applying. It shows experience in grad level physics. And any prior research from undergrad or grad would also definitely be an advantage in an app!</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for replying. Yes the user is interested in working in North America and they think they would prefer to pursue a PhD in Medical Physics, as they would like to keep the option of doing research in this field open, as opposed to the Masters which limits them to only doing clinical work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are the PhD programs fully funded? and do you have any universities that you would recommend to apply for the PhD program?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The user just wants to add that lots of MS physicists do research too, it just depends on their center's goals (eg academic vs community) and their own motivation.</p>

<p>Are there any common questions for graduate school interviews? The user has never done an actual interview so they're slightly nervous about a question asked that they have no idea how to answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the user had some light questions to see if they had looked into the science at all - like what effect does radiation have on biology? Then the rest were like to talk about a project or problem they had in school/work. Later on as a student participating in the next year’s class’ recruitment, they heard that by the time of the interview, they’re looking for more of a personality fit since the program is quite hands-on and collegial.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They definitely are mostly a fit thing. The user did have some questions about some modern physics like photoelectric effect and Compton but they think that was just to see if they were familiar with the concepts. > 95% of it was just talking about them and their interests and projects they worked on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The user would also suggest emphasizing why they want to go to XYZ program. They should know specifics about the university, the program, the city, the professors, etc. and be able to mention and show why they think this program would be good for them (i.e. not only why they are good enough for the program). Grad school interviews are a strange mix of both an interview and a recruitment. They want them, but they also want to make sure that they want them!</p>

<p>Can anyone provide the residency opportunities for master students except for COMP website? Thank you!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CAMPEP website lays out all residencies and gives links to their website. If the user is looking for residencies to start this July 2022 they are late, no more places to apply now. But it's good to prepare for next year's cycle.</p>
<p>Ps.: The individual program website says if they only take PhD students or Ms as well. MP-RAP also has that data available when they are applying.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Plenty of places say they only take PhDs but also only have MS in the program.</p>

<li>
<p>Does anyone have information on Brown University's graduate program?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of their faculty are pretty well known amongst the Medical Physics community so that will be a plus going forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What kind of information? It is brand new so they probably don't have anyone to talk about the program experience.</p>
