<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 04/25/2023</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

<p><b>Hi. I’m currently in a BME masters program with an undergrad BME. I just recently found about this field and medical physics programs after taking an MRI specialization class this semester. I’m already deep in my research MS thesis, which focuses on deep learning and image processing in histology images, but I would like to transition over to medical physics and apply my deep learning skill set to diagnostic imaging instead at the research setting. I was just wondering what’s the best way for me to make that transition. I’m looking to apply for PhD for fall 2024 and would like to apply to a medical physics PhD, but worried that I may not be the best candidate and want to know how I can improve my chances in the long run. I understand that there’s the MSMP programs, but since I’m already doing a masters in BME, I don’t want to do another MS program if I don’t have to. If I knew about this a 1.5 year ago before applying to BME MS, it would be a different story. I was just wondering if my transition from a BME masters to a PhD in medical physics is one that can be achieved.</b></p>
><p>Your background sounds solid to me. Most programs require at least a minor in physics before applying, but depending on your transcript and their policies they can have some wiggle room on prerequisites. Some places let you take 1 or 2 prerequisites after admission in your first year.</p>
<p><b>Hello, I’m a biophysics major, and a computer science minor. I will be graduating this semester. I have taken many science classes ranging from bio, organic/ inorganic chemistry, and physics. I have not taken differential equations, since it was not part of my major, but I have taken calculus 1,2 and 3. I have above a 3.5 GPA, and good recommendations letters. Just wanted to know what are my chances of getting into a medical physics MS program? Currently am just applying to two universities.</b></p>
><p>Getting into an MS program is relatively easily. I had an 80%+ success rate and similar (slightly better) stats. I would encourage you to apply widely though as 2 schools is a really small sample although you could get into either. Focus on getting into a program w/ a strong history of placing their graduates into residencies</p>
<p><b>Hii, so i am currently doing a master degree in medical physics, but as i live in an underdeveloped country (Lebanon), no certifications or any thing of such sorts exists, there are only 2 medical physics programs in the country, one is more of imaging focused, while mine focuses more on radiation therapy. (We are already able to start internships at some certain hopsital and legal to work within the country after graduation)
Does anyone have any sorts of advice to what i could do about getting a certification, or scoring an abroad certified phd program?</b></p>
