<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 09/20/2022</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

<p><b>I’m an astrophysics major, planning on applying to campep programs for grad school, but I’m in my third year and still have no research experience - I’ve asked around and every slot is simply taken or there’s just nothing “available”(It’s not like I’m not a good student or anything, I have good grades and have always maintained a good relationship with faculty). The only thing I can think of to really strengthen my grad school application when I apply next year is to shadow a physicist at a nearby clinic soon, but other than that I’m really starting to panic :(

Has anyone in grad school (or finished and already in the field) had similar issues? How did your graduate admissions for campep programs turn out?</b></p>
<p><b>Are there any summer research programs one can apply to as a graduate student for medical physics?</b></p>
<p><b>I currently have my A.S. I am in school to be a radiation therapist A.A.S. once I have I have it I plan to transfer and get my bachelor's in physics and then I may go for a post bachelor certification to be medical dosimetrist. My end goal is to be a medical physicist but I'm trying to pay for it. Does this seem like a good route?</b></p>
><p>kerma has made some good comments already, but I would add that the training pathways for becoming a therapist/dosimetrist and for becoming a medical physicist are effectively parallel lines in the US system. The most experienced dosimetrist in the world would still need to start fresh with, at minimum, a MS in Medical Physics from a CAMPEP program and complete a competitive 2 year residency before they could work alongside the physicists they collaborated with in their prior dosimetrist role.

If you want to be a physicist, I would encourage you to just go for it.</p>
>><p>Agreed, you put it much more eloquently than I did, lol.</p>
><p>I think if you do a masters it's likely you'll self pay, but there might be a few places that offer funding of some sort (I just don't know where). I think if you're up for it then it's a good career path. I don't think it is necessary to become a dosimetrist first; that may incur additional tuition burden for little reward.</p>
>><p>The reason I thought about the medical dosimetrist is because how much longer it may take to become a physcist. I heard a lot of places require a PhD. And I thought becoming a dosimetrist would maybe allow me to work with the physicist a little more while working toward it.

Do you like being a medical physicist assistant? I didn't know that was a position.</p>
>>><p>Yes there are places that are open to PhD holders only but MS physicists can do just fine. Dosimetry is a lot to learn in itself: I wouldn't see it as a "shortcut" to getting the requisite medical physics knowledge. 

I like being an MPA, but there aren't a lot of MPA openings typically so it is a bit difficult to come by. I also work with physicists a lot, but I don't want to overstate how much of an advantage that confers on me vis a vis my chances of getting a residency. That is as much about your personality and work ethic as it is your resume. Others who have gone through the residency process please feel free to chime in if you have anything to add.</p>
>>>><p>I don't necessarily see it as a shortcut but just a step along the path to being a medical physicist</p>
>>>>><p>Saying you want to become a dosimetrist to later become a physicist is like saying you want to become a nurse to later become a doctor. Sure they're related fields, but they're entirely different careers.</p>
>>>>>><p>I didn't realize the role between them was like that of nurse and doctor. As I said earlier I'm new to the process. Thank you for the clarification</p>
>>>>><p>I don't think that is true either. Yes some dosimetrists make the switch to physics but most don't. It may not do justice to our dosimetrist colleagues to see their profession as a stepping stone to something "bigger and better". Of course I may be reading too deeply into your posts so I apologize if I am assuming too much.</p>
<p><b>I am graduating with a BS in physics in December and am interested in going to grad school for medical physics next fall. In the meanwhile, I am wanting to work somewhat in the field with my bachelor's degree after I graduate. I thought about applying to some Medical Physicist Assistant jobs as they mostly seem to require a Bachelor's in physics. Would that be the best idea, or is there something better? Thanks!</b></p>
><p>I think it's a great option, if you can find a position and successfully apply to it. Unfortunately these positions are not super plentiful; you will probably need to relocate for one.</p>
<p><b>Is it possible to have a career as a radiotherapist, with only a biomedical engineering bachelor + master's degree? Is it different depending on the country? Do I have to do a master in physics or medical physics?</b></p>
><p>Not very likely in the United States. Most places want at least a masters in medical physics. Other countries may be possible. Not positive however.</p>
>><p>Thank you for your reply! I am a bit sad that I only realised I had a passion for medical physics after I enrolled in BME masters... I am quite lost in what to do. My Master's coordinator said it could be possible to get a radiotherapy physicist job if my thesis were related to that, and I got internship experience in that area, but I doubt it. :(</p>
>>><p>Unfortunately your master's coordinator was probably not familiar with CAMPEP, ABR and all the other medical physics stuff, which is understandable because that's not the kind of program you're in. Please take a look at the "Guide to a Medical Physics Career" document listed in the sidebar for a more detailed breakdown of what is required.</p>
>>>><p>But I don't think there is such thing in Europe right? Each country has its own rules, and for example here in Portugal, most of the job openings require only physics or engineering physics. At least from what I've seen on LinkedIn. I sent an email to DGMP in Germany and they told me I could persue this careeer with a BME Master's, but only if I did a radiation protection course, and that takes years. They also told me I could take it AFTER I got the job, which is confusing to me. I just wish I had someone to talk to, that was in the same situation as me, and in Europe. I plan on emigrating but I am a bit lost with my options. I could go to the USA but I don't have the money to get education there.</p>
>>>>><p>You're right CAMPEP is for USA/Canada, ABR for USA, COMP in Canada. Sorry you should have led with the fact that you are in Portugal. There might be some physicists from the EU that can tell you more but unfortunately I don't know how things work there.</p>
>>>>>><p>Thank you for your reply! I have to look more into it. :)</p>
><p>Just to clarify, did you mean to have a career as a radiotherapy physicist?  A radiotherapist is a very different role.</p>
>><p>Yes I did! I'm sorry!</p>
