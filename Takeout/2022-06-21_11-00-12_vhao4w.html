<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 06/21/2022</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

><p>For dosimetry board certification, you want to go to an accredited program that lasts at least 12 months. The ones I know of are 12 or 18 months, but there might be others. Here's a list: [https://www.jrcert.org/find-a-program/](https://www.jrcert.org/find-a-program/) Before that though, I would recommend finding a clinic near you and seeing if you can shadow a dosimetrist for a day or two. Good luck!</p>
<p><b>Which DMP program is the best between the ones below? (Therapy Track)

Wayne state vs UT san Antonio vs University of Nevada</b></p>
><p>Ask each of the residency directors about the number of graduates and their job placements. I’m not sure about the other institutions, but I’m only aware of 1 DMP graduating from WSU. The DMP as a whole isn’t exactly a common educational pathway.</p>
<p><b>Not sure if this is worthy of a full post or not, but here it goes. What (if any) countries would I be able to work in as a medical physicist after I pass ABR part 3. I know this accreditation is centered around the United States, but leaving the country might be an inticing option once I'm done with schooling, residency, and such. Does anyone know if other countries (like Germany for example) have the same sort of requirements? If so would I be able to apply for accreditation in other countries, using the ABR certification to count for something?</b></p>
><p>Check out the certifying body of the country you want to work in and see what qualifies as a similar certification. There are [alternate pathways](https://www.theabr.org/medical-physics/initial-certification/international-medical-graduates) for international Medical Physicists to become ABR certified in the US, maybe the same exists in Europe and elsewhere.</p>
<p><b>Any advice for someone who deals with anxiety/imposter syndrome? I am a strong student and love physics, but even still I sometimes feel like a fraud and that I am not smart enough. I am only undergrad still and want to learn how to deal with this before I start graduate school.</b></p>
><p>I was about to type up a full response, but DavidBits said it better than I could've. Just remember, whether or not it appears to be the case, many of your peers are probably in the same boat as you. It's hard to admit that you don't feel like you know something, but as you dive deeper into physics you learn that you still don't know a lot of things. It is just the nature of physics. I'm sure you are very smart and capable, but don't be afraid to admit you don't know something. Many other people probably don't know it either.</p>
><p>What helped me was realizing (and later discussing with my peers as well) that *most* of your peers feels the exact same way. You're literally surrounded by some of the brightest minds society has to offer, you yourself being there because you are also one. It's easy to be surrounded by that and feel... common. It's especially easy when you're literally there to push yourself and see firsthand that, no matter how much you think you know, there's an ocean of knowledge out there to explore. One lifetime isn't enough to explore it all, and that's fine. 

Cases of nepotism aside, yes, having the opportunity to be there involves a lot of luck, (never forget that, you're blessed to be there and be able to perform well, many aren't), for most it still requires a lot of work and dedication to be there and be a strong student, especially in a field such as ours.

In my time in undergrad, in gradschool, and in my time as a research associate, many many people felt the same way. Some of the smartest people I know routinely called themselves dumb just because they weren't knowledgeable in some particular skill or area, which is ridiculous. Everybody explores different parts of that ocean. Explore what you want and forget the rest.

Also, I love physics as well and understand a lot of it fairly well, but a lot of times physics is just plain hard haha.</p>
<p><b>For myself and others who are starting residency soon:

Any tips or recommendations for residency? Resources to read, useful things to have, general strategies to go through it successfully, etc.?</b></p>
><p>Residency, unlike grad school, is a job with specific professional expectations. Be on time. Go to all meetings. Remember to be present and ask questions, but also most people in your department are there to do a job, so don't be a nuisance. Work hard and have fun!</p>
><p>My advice hasn’t changed much: You are there to learn and are not expected to know everything going in. Make an effort to be present in whatever you are doing and ask questions often. Let your current rotation guide your reading. I would review material and reports from previous rotations often to keep things fresh. 

Get to know everyone in the department well. Not just physics/dosi and doctors. Nurses, MA, IT, cleaning staff etc. They will all be helpful to you many times and it’s good to build those relationships. 

Enjoy your time and good luck!</p>
<p><b>What’s the fastest way to get through the education process? I plan on summer classes. Anything else?</b></p>
><p>I’m not aware of any accelerated programs or self paced programs. Maybe someone else might? 
Most graduate begin in the fall semester and run two years. That time usually has specific classes, labs, and/or rotations that only run at specific times during that two year cycle. Then you would need a two year residency assuming board certification is your end goal. Add extra time for PhD if you go that route. 

Things to help speed up or make the process easier:
Take pre reqs in undergrad or at a community college. Just make sure they transfer. 
Complete ABR Part 1 between years 1 and 2 of school. It’s something nice to have completed on your application for residency but not required. You will need to register for this test early in year 1 so get on the website to check deadlines early!</p>
>><p>Thank you!</p>
<p><b>Any tips for applying to residency, such as how you’re CV should be formatted?</b></p>
><p>Check out an online CV creator and find some of their templates to see which one you like best. It should look professional (not whacky) but a fresh look will beat the bland ones we see all the time. At the end of the day though it’s about the content of the résumé not the format so make sure you include all the relevant information in it.</p>
>><p>There are lots of \\LaTeX templates that look good too if that's your cup of jam</p>
><p>I think I just copied a template online or from Google docs for mine. As for the content, I took advice from my advisor and program director. For better or worse, I added every single tool or experience I was familiar with from school. I also tried to be clear about what I observed versus what I was an active participant in. “Performed IMRT QA with MapCheck, Portal Dosimetry” and “Observed Eclipse SBRT planning”. My theory was they would see what equipment I was exposed to and could pick up quickly and that my graduate program prepared me in a wide range of regular clinical experiences. It probably ended up being longer than it needed to be but it ended up working out for me. 

I did include a single page resume as well so they could get a summary at a glance. Try to keep your resume and CV updated every few months during residency and even throughout your career. You never know when you’ll want to send out an application.</p>
><p>I think formatting is pretty open, people in my class had a variety of different looks. The sections are also a little arbitrary, obviously need education and clinical experience sections. Publications and/or conference posters/presentations should also be in there, maybe some work experience if it helped you in developing pertinent skills. Be creative to help yourself stand out!</p>
