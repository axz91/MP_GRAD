<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 06/28/2022</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

<p><b>I am starting a medical physics MS next month. Could anyone elaborate on what graduate school and the courseload is like?</b></p>
><p>Depends on the university, but the best advice I've heard from multiple people is "you get what you put in to it." Be proactive, explore different research areas and seek out collaborators (from the Radiology or Biology department for example), look at important dates like when you need to apply to ABR part 1 or when the AAMP and other big conferences are, they will sneak up on you. Get to know the 2nd year and PhD students, they will have the insider info.

I don't think the course load is that bad semester to semester. Some teachers expect you to read the section they plan on presenting before class. Try to invest your time wisely, especially if you are going to be a TA. I tried to reflect on what I did poorly during undergrad and make sure I improve on those areas. This will be a common interview question too.</p>
<p><b>So I am a nuclear medicine technologist certified in CT as well. I’m looking to get into a MS in MP program. Do you think it would be possible without me having to go back to school and get a bachelors in physics ? I have 2 bachelors degrees actually. One in HSc and one in Nuclear Medicine Technology. The course work for my second bachelors degree is actually very similar to the first year med phys coursework. Any advice ? Should I take the physics GRE to help my case ?</b></p>
><p>I’m not so sure, you would definitely need to make sure you have maths courses up to junior year (PDE’s) and Junior/Senior level courses in QM, E&M, Stat. Mech and Classical mechanics for proper admission chances. You’re applying to Medical physics and you may have some
experience and some course work related to the field, but most medical physics programs are apart of their physics departments and you usually have to meet the general graduate admission requirements for these physics departments first before declaring an area of intent. 

Now I’m not sure if you need to do a third BSc with your background, but rather just take the aforementioned courses. The issue is they have pre-requisites and build on each other. 

I think the best course of action is to email the graduate medical physics program advisors/admissions officers and fill them in on your background and transcripts, along with your experience, and they can best advise you. 

Also, I’m not sure if the Physic GRE will help either. Alot of schools are now kinda flushing it out. Also, it covers Classical mechanics, QM, Stat. Mech, E&M, Optics & Waves, Atomic physics, Lab methods, special Relatively, etc. Without proper coursework up to senior/junior level in physics and math, it would definitely be quite the challenge preparing for it so it may not be the best course of action. At the same time, if you manage to do very well in it, it could help. I just don’t see the time and effort being put in to it being worth much of a pay off in your specific situation.</p>
>><p>I may be wrong, but most schools only ask for the General GRE, not the Physics GRE. But you are correct, they are slowly phasing the GRE out but most programs still require it</p>
>><p>This was a great response. I appreciate it!</p>
><p>\> Do you think it would be possible without me having to go back to school and get a bachelors in physics ?

You'll need to find out from the program(s) you're interested what their prerequisites are and if your previous course work satisfies any or all of those prereqs.  Best case scenario is that they do and you get accepted into the program.  Likely case is they want you to take some senior level physics or some other courses.  They may or may not want the GRE (probably not the Physics GRE though).</p>
