<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 10/25/2022</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

<p><b>I am a graduate medical physics student and am wondering if I can apply for residency (through the match) and industry jobs at the same time? I know if I get a residency it is a binding contract, but if I don’t get a residency it would be nice to already start the process of looking for an industry job. Additionally, if an industry job is a perfect fit could I drop out of the match?</b></p>
><p>Per match rules, you cab drop out before the match closes. I wouldn't be openly mentioning that you're also pursuing industry positions as some may take that as a lack of interest in the clinical side of things. Also, industry positions will know they have leverage over your when negotiating compensation (e.g., they know you have until match day to accept and that a match isn't a guaranteed thing).</p>
><p>I don’t think there’s anything wrong with looking for industry jobs while applying in the match. Also you can drop out of the match as long as is before the match day</p>
<p><b>Hello All!  

I am currently finishing up my BS in Health Science. I have a goal of applying for grad program in Medical dosimetry.  I have a background in healthcare (surgery) but not radiation. With all that said... before I spend the next 2 years diving into this career

What do you think are some great traits of a medical dosimetrist?</b></p>
><p>I would agree with the previous comments, but also place an emphasis on time management and collaboration. Especially at busier clinics, dosimetrists can get slammed with cases, so it is important to manage your time effectively and speak up if you need help with something. We all want the best for our patients, so collaboration and helping each other out is great</p>
><p>I would say the best dosimetrists I've worked with were meticulous in their process, and creative in their problem solving. 

Most of their work can be pretty repetitive and that can lead to complacency errors. When they run into difficult cases, being able to get creative and figure out the solutions to the limiting aspects helps me out immensely. 

The top 2 or 3 that I've worked with were also excellent communicators and really helped bridge gaps between physicians, physicists and therapists. After all they probably have the most overlapping and dependant aspects of any of our coworkers.</p>
>><p>Thank you for the reply!  It's a huge help. I want to lean into the soft skills that make a great dosimetrist.</p>
>>><p>I'd argue that those kinds of soft skills will get you very far in many fields (especially such a human centric one as healthcare) not just dosimetry. I wish more people understood this, especially hardcore STEM types.</p>
><p>Hi, this is a reddit section for medical physics, not dosimetry. I'm sure some of the therapy physicists could help you with your question, but going to a dosimetry thread would be beneficial to you (by getting answers from actual medical dosimetrists)</p>
>><p>Thank you for the response.  The medical dosimetry reddit only allows "trusted members" to post. Historically I have seen some medical dosimetry post here also. 

By chance, do you work with medical dosimetry? What has your experience been? 

Thanks again for the reply.</p>
