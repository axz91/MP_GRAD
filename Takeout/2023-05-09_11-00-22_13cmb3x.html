<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 05/09/2023</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

<p><b>Plan on doing dosimetry in Florida. Does any know any medical dosimetry that are in Florida besides from university of Miami ?</b></p>
><p>Are you looking for schools or work? Have you looked into any remote dosimetry schools/positions?</p>
<p><b>Did anyone here do research as a DMP student? I am curious if it is possible and would allow someone to get a MS during the DMP program. Also, I am going to UNLV in the fall for the DMP program and was wondering if anyone here went and how it was going there. Thanks!</b></p>
><p>Research is not required for an MS.  As far as I know, it is not possible to earn an MS while in a DMP program.</p>
<p><b>Saw this question asked previously, wanted insight from the community into which courses should I take to fulfill. I have a nuc med degree, already have nuclear physics course. 

A two‐semester calculus‐based introductory physics course

Three advanced physics courses</b></p>
><p>You've had two semesters of college chemistry?  One semester of anatomy and physiology?  Typically, any course required in CAMPEP-accredited programs **can't count** either as an advanced undergraduate course OR be accepted for credit in a CAMPEP-accredited program.  At least under the original CAMPEP requirements, which, as far as I know, are still the requirements.  There might be exceptions, but I would guess that few, if any, nuc med degree courses count.  A nuclear physics course could be an advanced undergrad physics course IF the calc-based intro physics series is a prerequisite.  A nuclear medical physics course will not count as an advanced undergraduate course.  Are your three advanced physics courses non-medical-physics oriented and require the calculus-based intro physics as prerequisites?  Examples of "upper level" physics courses that are **not what's intended,** **and not generally accepted** as upper-level physics courses:  astronomy, instructional physical science, math methods of physics, computational methods of physics, electronics, optics, biomedical physics, medical physics, biophysics, radiological physics, diagnostic physics, \[insert modality\] physics, radiation therapy physics, radiation biology, nuclear medicine physics, radiation protection, radiation detection, etc.  There **might** be CAMPEP graduate programs that might accept some of these, but be aware that **not every residency program will**.  Note that while optics doesn't count, a course called optics & wave phenomena likely will, if it's based in differential equations.</p>
>><p>Thank you for your response but this was a big read and I got really lost.  These are CAMPEP requirements for GA Tech graduate program

I’m only asking for insight into courses that fit these specific requirements. 

For example does general physics with calculus I and II meet the “ calculus based introductory physics course requirement”</p>
>>><p>Any gen phys I and II that require calc I and II as prerequisites do count as calculus-based intro physics.

The rest of the undergrad requirements will require gen phys II (with calc) as a prerequisite.  Most commonly, the other undergrad courses will be: 1) modern physics (aka relativity & quantum physics) usually sophomore or junior level; 2) classical mechanics (aka dynamics) usually junior or senior level; 3) electricity & magnetism (aka electromagnetic theory) usually junior or senior level; 4) quantum mechanics usually senior level.</p>
>>>><p>This is what I was looking for!! Thank you so much for your reply!!! This helps a lot</p>
>>>>><p>I was on the same boat from nuc med. This was years ago but here is what I took: calc i and ii (to understand the following list), physics i and ii with calculus, optics, electronics lab, quantum/modern physics and electricity and magnetism.  The electricity and magnetism for me was at the senior/masters level.  You got this!

Edit: by the way, your nuc med physics course doesnt count. It is nice to have a base to understand everything else in the masters degree.</p>
>>>>>><p>I was hoping to find a fellow nuc med person here!! Thank you kindly for this information very helpful!!</p>
>>>>>>><p>Feel free to PM me</p>
