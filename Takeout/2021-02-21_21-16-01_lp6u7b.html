<h3>Post Title: Career Question.</h3>
<p>Post Content: Hi all,

I am currently deciding whether to enter a CAMPEP MS program in medical physics. I was wondering if medical physics has been a fulfilling career? Would you do it again? Would you recommend it? What would you have done differently?</p>

<p><b>This job is repetitive and boring, if you are not into groundhog measurements and QAs, then it would be better to find something else.
Also, it is somehow biased and unfair, if you are not connected and have a good network you will end up working in a s* place regardless of your intelligence and skills.</b></p>

<p><b>I worked (from home) nearly all day today (Sunday).  I have a hugely busy primary job, and I have two side gigs.  I look forward to go to work every day.  And I am rewarded handsomely for my hard work - which makes me feel overpaid because I really enjoy what I do.  If you aren't into this for some reason though, I think that you will get weeded out over the long term.</b></p>
<p><b>I’m at home on a Sunday night and I look forward to work tomorrow. Before I went back to grad school to get my MS in medphys, I worked as an engineer. Sunday night was the worst because I would dread the next day. I’ve been a clinical physicist almost 4 years, plus 2 years residency, and I truly enjoy it. Switching careers was the best choice I ever made. And I also speak with high school physics classes about this career path, so I definitely recommend it!</b></p>
><p>Wow!! I don’t normally reply on these things but This is the same exact story as mine except that I’m still I grad school. Former engineer. Quit my job to pursue a medphys career and currently in my last semester of my MS. Enjoying what I am learning and I already see how I’m making at difference in the clinics. Looking forward to residency and eventually a paycheck ;)</p>
>><p>Awesome, glad to hear another story like mine! I have found the engineering background to serve me extremely well clinically, especially troubleshooting linac issues and identifying ways to improve QA workflows. I also believe residency programs really valued the fact that I had worked in “the real world” and wasn’t an undergrad straight to grad student to residency. For some people working a proper 40+ hour week for the first time in their life can be a real struggle, not the kind of risk a residency wants to take if they don’t have to.</p>
><p>Thank you for your input!</p>
<p><b>I’m finishing my residency this summer and will start my career as a faculty, primarily working in the clinic immediately after graduating. So far it’s been fulfilling for me. I get to work with advanced technology and use it to treat patients, and often literally save their lives. I enjoy my team around me, which includes radiation oncologists, therapists, other medical physicists, dosimetrists and nurses, among others. Sure, a decent amount of the work is routine and repetitive, but that’s just the reality of clinical medicine. I’d do it all the same again. I don’t have any regrets about where I went to school or did residency. 

But that’s just my personal experience. The question of “is med phys fulfilling to you” is of course, very personal and depends on what the person you’re asking is looking for. I think the best question you need to ask yourself is if a career in med phys offers you most of the things you’re looking for.</b></p>
><p>Thanks for your answer!</p>
