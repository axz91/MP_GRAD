<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 08/09/2022</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

<p><b>Any dosimetrists in or near Madison WI? I am interested in the UWL Dosimetry Master's Program, and one of the requirements is 40 hours of observation. Any help would be appreciated.</b></p>
<p><b>TLDR; what options for work are there for a MP M.S. holder with no residency?

Howdy everyone! I'm going to be entering Georgia Tech's MP M.S. this August. I'm really excited to go, however, I'm sort of dreading the residency process. Residency acceptance rates are really *really* dismally low, especially for those only holding an M.S. Questions are:

1. If I were to fail to be accepted to a residency in my first go-around or two, what could I possibly do as a stop-gap? 
2. What jobs make me more attractive to residencies? 
3. Furthermore, what can one do with just a MP M.S. for an indefinite amount of time? 

Thank you ALL so much! Excited to join your ranks :)</b></p>
><p>1. You can work as an MP which is a good way to make some money and get experience on the field. You can also go work in industry, that's the route for non-residency MS holders.
2. Any job in a cancer treatment center or radiology department, depending on what type of residency you want to do. Try to shadow physicists and get some hands on experience on the different equipment types.
3. Going back to 1, with an MS you can become a MP assistant, but mostly I see people going into industry.</p>
<p><b>Hello Everyone, I wonder if an applicant who has not fully completed a certificate program (non-medical-physics Ph.D.) is eligible or could be considered for residency application? In this case, the applicant could write how many courses have been completed and how many will be finished. This will be written in a personal statement. Or, would it be possible that 1 or 2 courses could be done during residency training? Thank you!</b></p>
><p>Pretty sure everyone requires that all courses be completed by residency start date.</p>
<p><b>Hi, y'all I wanted to enquire about how strict schools were with GPA requirements. I messed up one semester which brought my GPA down to 2.8 due to a death in the family (my sister) in the middle of a semester and it was past the withdrawal date so I stupidly finished out the semester. I have done just fine in my higher-level classes and have 2 years of research experience (a pair of second authorships). Will I have an opportunity to explain the circumstances at all in hopes of a conditional acceptance? My professors who are writing my letters of recommendation know about this situation and have said that there is potential that semester could be sort of overlooked since I have made amends in my following semesters to rectify the academic mistakes. My sister's death has now become the reason I want to go into medical physics as well and I apologize for being all over the place here.</b></p>
><p>I have personal experience with exactly this. During my undergrad, I had *several* semesters in the middle of my degree where my GPA fell around to your level (one was even lower) due to a serious medical issue I was going through. My overall GPA was around 3.3 after all was said on done. I had a semester of research experience (no publications) and was non-traditional since I worked in finance for a bit. I explained all of this in my personal statement and during interviews. I also explained how it ultimately influenced me to pursue medical physics. 

While your experience will vary (so take mine with a grain of salt), I was accepted into the three MS programs I preferred and applied to (for one, I was waitlisted, but eventually accepted to it). It's certainly possible for you as well, just make sure to compliment your application with signs of interest (I shadowed a local physicist to better understand what I was attempting to get into) with good LORs and things that show you're safe (this is literally the most important aspect of our life), mature and can handle the stresses of a graduate program.</p>
>><p>This was really helpful thank you, I needed to hear this</p>
<p><b>I currently work in a hospital and recently had a conversation with our medical physicist who does diagnostic only. He said that there’s not a big pay difference between master’s and PhD (were in Arizona). Is that generally the case? He also recommended going the therapeutic route since there are many more job opportunities. I just want to confirm with these claims because I originally was interested in the diagnostic route but after hearing that it seems like I might switch to therapeutic. Both seem interesting to me.</b></p>
><p>Yes there is a somewhat higher salary for PhD holders but depending on the center they may have additional duties like research and/or teaching that offsets that additional money. As far as therapy vs imaging you won't be on unemployment with imaging but you certainly have fewer total job openings to apply to. However, therapy usually works more hours, especially at academic centers. Personally I am going diagnostic because I am much more interested in the imaging side of medical physics, as well as the somewhat better work/life balance.</p>
<p><b>First time posting here as I try and determine what path to take to transition into the field of MP. Currently have a BS in Astrophysics and BS in Computational Mathematics. Some grad coursework done in Nuclear Engineering only for my time in the military but no degree out of it; so now that I'm post-military, time to focus on this transition!

Located in the DC area with my husband where we are starting our family soon. In this area they really only have MSMP programs at Georgetown U (CAMPEP approved) or Johns Hopkins U (CAMPEP pending, new-ish program). Logistically staying in DC would be best for now and then later moving to a PhD program elsewhere. Yet I'm well aware where some of the better MP grad programs are, where I could enroll in a PhD program immediately somewhere around the country, just don't know how feasible living apart from my family would be (also not ideal since we have only ever done that living the military life and I'm exhausted from it) or picking up and moving us all when my husband has a full blown career too. I know we'll have to figure that out though...

Questions to the group - any familiarity with a pending CAMPEP MSMP program as far as timeline goes to become CAMPEP accredited; familiarity with Med Physics programs at JHU specifically, or Georgetown; or any guidance on if pursuing a PhD in Physics etc and then later getting a CAMPEP Certificate is worth it or is it frowned upon in industry. Thanks in advance for any insight to any of the above situations presented. Sounds like each path has a lot of benefits to it for your individual academic and career path. Working with the patients is a goal of mine for sure in addition to research.</b></p>
><p>If your goal is to do clinical physics, you can still make that happen with an MS (no PhD). You will have difficulty being "faculty" but you can still be very involved with research as a MS.

If your goal is to *really* do research, one other route you could take is get the CAMPEP accredited MS and then continue on doing a PhD in biophysics, bioengineering, etc, with one of the faculty who are involved in medical physics. The CAMPEP MS will make you eligible for ABR Part 1. NOTE: I don't know what the timelines are (e.g., if you get your MS and pass ABR Part 1 in 2025 and finish your PhD in 2029, would you be OK to take ABR Part 2 in 2031 when you finish residency?). this is something to look up. 

The certificate program has mixed reviews. I know some people that did the certificate program and had no problem getting residency, whereas others didn't even get interviews for residency. In general (and obviously) it seems like if your non-CAMPEP PhD is medical physics related, you will have much better luck going the certificate pathway.

One other thing to consider is that you will need to do a CAMPEP accredited residency. Are you willing to move for this if you don't get one locally? Same thing for a job, particularly if you want a faculty job.

Finally, if your goal is working with patients, you should be aware that many medical physicists rarely work with patients. Some medical physicists do, but many have very little patient interaction.</p>
>><p>Echoing this sentiment about moving. Limiting yourself to one city/metro is going to reduce your chances of getting a residency \_significantly\_.</p>
>>><p>Thank you to you both. I really am not a fan of limiting myself to one location at all, just not ideal logistically at this stage, but I guess that is where we make the necessary sacrifices up front to do what is best for the long haul. I'd like to apply for a variety of PhD MP programs, none of which are in the DC area, so that is already something we are considering is having to move - UPenn is nearby, but I imagine highly competitive, so I will apply there and that would put me in a place to be nearby to DC if my family were to stay here. Just kinda gotta see what programs I get into.

Definitely when I get to the residency portion of whichever path, we will be open to moving. Not tied to DC at all, just right now getting into a graduate program I'm trying to weigh my local options before we up and move. 

Ideally I'd like to find a PhD program in MP, get a MS along the way perhaps, find a residency, get board certified, get a job. That seeeeeems to be the best path forwards from several discussions I've had... Thanks again for the insight.</p>
>>>><p>I think that in your situation it really comes down to whatever you and your husband are most comfortable with, redditor advice can't compete with that discussion haha. But know that MS and PhD holders both go on to have successful careers in MP, it's just they usually have to move a bit in the beginning.</p>
<p><b>Hey everyone! I was wondering when best to apply for a phd when doing a masters in medical physics. I wish to go from masters to PhD and I was wondering how the process looked, when best to apply, and whether or not master students hold more merit than undergrad students. Thank you!</b></p>
><p>Generally: master's holders have an advantage over non-masters holders all other things held equal, because you show that you can handle a graduate curriculum, and probably do legit research too (if you have some abstracts or a publication under your belt), all very important things for PhD candidates. Now specifically, if you are already in a master's program, and your school has a PhD track in your department, there probably exists some formal mechanism for transitioning to the PhD track outside the normal application route, with its own deadlines and paperwork. Check if that is the case at your school.</p>
<p><b>Hello Everyone, 

I'm planning to apply to a MedPhys Ph.D. program after pivoting from a pre-med trajectory. The problem is that I have all these LORs I intended to use for med school. My question is can I use my med school LORs for my Medphys app or if I should ask for a new LOR?</b></p>
><p>Absolutely get new LORs. Assuming that you got good letters the first time around, there are going to be multiple arguments by your letter writers as to why you would be a great fit for *med school specifically*. No PhD admissions committee is going to want to see that in your application packet.</p>
><p>It kind of depends on your relationship with each reference imo. I can't speak to what med school LORs are typically like content-wise, but you'll want at least one LOR to specifically speak to your research abilities/potential for PhD applications. PhDs are essentially research positions, so unless you were planning to apply for MD/PhD programs, then I'd think you'll want LORs more specific to research, and ideally research relevant to medphys . Other than that, I think application reviewers really like to see demonstrated commitment to the path you're applying for, considering a PhD is at least a 4-year investment for both parties. If your LORs have a med school vibe to them, that could be an immediate turn-off to some reviewers in a medphys PhD program because it would cause them to question whether you either mistakenly applied or are not fully aware of what a PhD in medphys entails. So if you have a mentor that you've discussed a medical physics career with, or even better a medical physicist you've worked with, I'd ask them for a LOR.

TLDR: you'll at least want new versions of the original LORs to tailor it specifically to medphys/research potential to be safe. best of luck!</p>
<p><b>Hello everyone! First-time poster here, but I have followed this sub for a few years now :) Having recently finished my PhD and turning towards residency preparation, I had a few more questions building off the recent medphys match discussion. I have spoken to a couple programs wanting to leave the match- they are hoping to secure a resident in the next couple months. Can anyone give insight into the potential benefits of getting a residency outside of the match? Is it a "red flag" if you accept a position outside of the match? What about relatively new programs wanting to operate outside the match (or are newer programs something to look out for in general)? Of course it's nice to be wooed, but I worry that this may limit exposure to other programs, although we do have the secondary residency fair coming up.

&#x200B;

It's a stressful (and exciting) decision- ultimately it comes down to finding the best fit possible and getting certified.  This obviously adds some pressure. Any advice (therapy or diagnostic) would be appreciated!</b></p>
><p>definitely not a red flag! you gotta do what's best for you, match or no match. would agree with the other comment regarding newer programs, be careful there. Anecdotally, I applied to one non-match program i was interested in, didn't hear back then entered the match. So if you're at all interested in a non-match program, it doesn't hurt to apply and see what happens as long as you understand what you're getting yourself into</p>
><p>Benefit - you have a residency position. congrats! You don't need to interview at 10+ places, spend thousands of dollars on travel (maybe less now due to remote interviews), or worry about matching.

Negative - you have a residency position. You are locked into this residency and cannot explore other residencies (if you back out of any agreement, it will look really bad for you). You are correct, it will limit your exposure to other programs.

Negative - is the new program CAMPEP accredited? If not, that is something to be worried about, unless you are confident they will get accredited. If the program is CAMPEP and in good standing this is not a concern.

Red flag - no one will care, or probably even remember, if your residency program was in or not in the match in 2.5-3 years when you graduate.</p>
