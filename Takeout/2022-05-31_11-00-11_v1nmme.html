<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 05/31/2022</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

<p><b>Starting a medical physics residency out of state (Illinois).  Must or should I change my address for driver's license?  After the 2-year program, I have no specific plans to stay so I don't know if this counts as a "permanent" move.  I didn't change driver's licenses for my out-of-state graduate program though that situation does seem different.</b></p>
><p>What I got from browsing some of the medical residency subs is that it’s an even 50/50 split between those who change their license or not. Personally, I won’t be changing mine bc it’s a hassle and I have no plans of staying in the state my residency will be</p>

><p>The two alternatives I've seen people have coming into a graduate program is Nuclear Engineering and Computer Science.  Of course, as long you have the equivalent of a minor in physics and a strong case for why your choosing Medical Physics in your personal statement it should not matter what your major is as long as its a hard science major.</p>
><p>I would say astrophysics is pretty good, and other good ones are Nuclear and Mechanical eng. I would say also try to get a anatomy class, and stay on top on the physics requirements for the programs you are planning to apply.</p>
>><p>Lol I’m an astrophysics major, but I only decided a few months ago that medical physics sounded like a way more exciting and fulfilling career. It’s relieving to hear you say that haha</p>
>>><p>Hahah I graduated in astrophisics and it helped a lot, especially because of the radiation detectors class I took, which gaved an overview about pretty much all emthofs of radiation detectiom for medical physics (just not uktrasound). In my opinion I would advise you to stay in Astro if its something you enjoy, and play your strengths on grad school applications</p>
>>>><p>Great, thank you so much! Are there any specific  classes you’d recommend other than the traditional physics classes and anatomy/chemistry? I’ve been looking at potential physics internships but anything for medical physics just seems so limited lol</p>
>>>>><p>You should be hood with those! But again, the radiation detectors class I had was good and figuring out if you wanna do therapy or imaging before grad school can help as well. Yeah, you can broaden the search for anything related to imaging, therapy whatever. Any experience will help a lot</p>
<p><b>I just finished undergrad with a degree in Biomedical Engineering and would prefer to work for a bit before starting grad school. What job options would help me beef up my application? I already did a minor in physics and took all the recommended classes for the MSMP at Georgia Tech, but I'd really like to work 40 hours a week for a while and sort out some personal things for the next year or so.</b></p>
><p>I taught high school physics and calculus for a year and the people that interviewed me in my PhD applications really liked that. For a Master's it might be less beneficial, but could help you land a teaching assistantship for funding. 

I would not suggest an engineering job as they will be hard to get out of on your own time. If you're planning on taking more than a couple years, you might be able to find a relevant engineering job that would help your application, but again I do not recommend as the salary might be hard to leave. If you're planning on doing research (aka if you want to eventually get a PhD or Research Assistantship), get a Research assistant job. 

Otherwise, if you just need to make money and are going for a Master's (and no PhD), any sort of technical job you can find would be fine I bet. As nutrap said, physics assistant or some sort of medical physics related job might be hard to find with just a bachelor's, but would make the most sense if you happen upon one.</p>
><p>Nothing really comes to mind as something I could see to buff your resume outside of working as like a physics assistant or for some company that is highly involved in radiology or radiation oncology. Something very specific like that might help but may be extremely hard to come by. 

Definitely if you think you need a while before starting a Medical Physics degree, take your time. You will want to focus your time on becoming a medical physicist once you start.</p>
<p><b>Can medical physicists get MRIs or CT scans for theirselves whenever they’d like? (Not saying it’s a good or bad idea)</b></p>
><p>No, you need a physician’s prescription to receive a diagnostic scan (e.g. MRI, CT, etc.).</p>
