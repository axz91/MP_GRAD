<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 09/27/2022</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

<p><b>Hi! I’m a Canadian undergrad studying medical physics aiming to get into the medical physics field. However my grades are quite average. I make up for this with research, I’ve published one paper so far and working on a second, both related to oncology. I also do research in another health care field. Do you believe that my amount of research could supplement for my average grades?</b></p>
><p>I would make an effort to build a relationship with faculty in medical physics programs who you might work with as a graduate student. Having faculty advocate for you is the best way to get into grad school no matter your grades.</p>
<p><b>[deleted]</b></p>
><p>I had no issues matching with a masters. Same with everyone in my class along with many years before and after me. Some more clinical positions actually will prefer masters applicants due to clinical work versus someone with a lot of research background.</p>
><p>If you don't want a PhD don't do a PhD. You can absolutely match with a masters.</p>
<p><b>Those of you in radiation therapy - how often do you meet and talk to your patients? I’ve been told patient exposure varies WILDLY between different hospitals and clinics</b></p>
><p>As a resident, so far the only patient interaction I’ve had is with placing oslds where I have to explain what they are real quick and introducing myself during hdr treatments.</p>
><p>We usually don’t speak to the patients, unless they want to ask us something. But most of the time there’s absolutely no interaction with the patients.</p>
>><p>And then when they request to speak to the physicist you never know what kind of question you’re going to get from them. However, the majority of the time it’s something simple the therapists or doctor could have explained. How much radiation are they getting or something like that. Occasionally I’ve had patients in related  science fields that just want to nerd out about how linacs work.</p>
>>><p>We all lowkey enjoy a little talk shop with anyone interested in this field</p>
<p><b>What residency programs that will accept international students they hold F1 visa as OPT?</b></p>
><p>>There's a bunch really, before applying check their MP-RAP page, sometimes they disclose it there. If Not, email the program directors for the places you want to apply too (that's what I did).</p>
<p><b>Does anyone have an inside scoop on if/where there will be new CAMPEP residencies opening up in the next couple years?</b></p>
><p>Not an inside scoop but look at the non accredited residencies (google them or see if any are listed on match as non accredited if they can participate) and usually they will state they are in process of getting CAMPEP accreditation. At that point, call the residency director and see where they are in that process and their expected dates (site visit and such)</p>
<p><b>(Copied from the last thread as I shared it really late and no one responded)

I’m an astrophysics major, planning on applying to campep programs for grad school, but I’m in my third year and still have no research experience - I’ve asked around and every slot is simply taken or there’s just nothing “available”(It’s not like I’m not a good student or anything, I have good grades and have always maintained a good relationship with faculty). The only thing I can think of to really strengthen my grad school application when I apply next year is to shadow a physicist at a nearby clinic soon, but other than that I’m really starting to panic :(

Has anyone in grad school (or finished and already in the field) had similar issues? How did your graduate admissions for campep programs turn out?

Edit: thanks for the responses! I’ll try and keep looking, but it’s really frustrating with still having nothing to show for all my efforts :/</b></p>
><p>I had little research experience in undergrad, but am also not really “traditional” as I worked for a few years before deciding I wanted to do medical physics. I think that getting clinical experience will be useful. My undergrad GPA was okay, not great. But I worked as a medical physics assistant and got into Georgia Tech’s MSMP program.</p>
>><p>Sending you a DM!</p>
><p>Had similar issues with lack of research experience. Didn’t start until my spring semester of my 3rd year. And my main research i did in undergrad was in Chem. I don’t think that was too big of an issue in my application because I applied for a MS position. I can imagine it’ll be a bigger issue if you’re wanting to apply for a PhD. Personally, got admissions to places I wanted.</p>
><p>Your research doesn't necessarily have to be in the physics department. I did biochem and bio research in undergrad (although I was a biochem/phys double major). If you aren't finding something in your department expand your search to anything you might find interesting. Most professors could use a helping hand, just try to find one that is actually willing to mentor you vs one who wants cheap labor.</p>
