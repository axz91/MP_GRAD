<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 03/21/2023</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

<p><b>Hi all

I am a nuclear medicine tech currently. Recently I have been looking into career change possibilities, mainly due to the lack of progression/advancement in the field. I’ve been considering medical physics. I took basic calculus and physics courses in college but not any higher level courses. Do MS programs value experience in nuclear medicine? Of course I see many of them wanting physics or engineering degrees, but not sure how well I would translate to what these programs look for. I’ve always been interested in the radiation therapy side of MP. Any insight or tips are greatly appreciated!</b></p>
><p>> Do MS programs value experience in nuclear medicine?

I doubt it will hurt your application at all.  You'll probably need a BS degree if you don't already have one.

Do some research into graduate programs (CAMPEP accredited if you're in the US or Canada) you'd be interested in attending, learn a bit about them and contact the faculty doing research you'd be interested in.</p>

><p>The minimum requirement for a Masters program is a minor equivalent of physics. Most applicants (such as myself) are physics undergrads. There are also people from nuclear and biomedical engineering programs as well as long as they have the equivalent of a physics minor. As a Physics PhD. student, I would argue you are way overqualified for a masters program, but you can definitely go that route. The certificate programs require a PhD. in physics, so you fit the prerequisites for those programs. 

As far as residency goes, you can look at the programs on the campeps website (only apply to programs that are accredited), and I would filter based on residency match rates. Places like Kentucky and LSU and Vanderbilt have very good stats. The masters Program in kentucky has matched 98% of all masters graduates over the past 10 years or so. The one person who didn't match was an international student that returned to their home country. I can't speak to the specifics of other programs, but there are a few top-tier programs you should try to target. 

As far as the certificate route, i can only speak that the graduate student whom I assisted in undergrad was doing the certificate program. They took classes on the side while doing their Physics PhD. and ended up securing a residency at Mayo. So, I know this path is also a valid option. Either way, it'd be up to you. I would go whichever route is cheapest personally.</p>
<p><b>Any MS students that go to Creighton or graduates from the school? What was your experience like in the program?</b></p>
<p><b>Masters vs PhD? I've heard from some that the major difference for clinical practice is residency placement rates, a salary difference, and research ability. Can anyone expand on that? I'm mostly interested in clinical work</b></p>
><p>Salary difference is minimal (within $10-20k, iirc) unless you start comparing leadership positions, from what Ive seen. Certainly not enough to make up for the opportunity cost of not working for and additional 3-4 years. 

Residency placement rates are definitely better for PhD candidates (almost guaranteed). But MS is certainly not awful, as someone who has an MS. Some places even prefer MS due to historical observations in their clinic showing MS applicants tend to be better equipped to start working clinically faster. Ultimately, its all about how strong your clinical experience is, and some PhD programs place very little emphasis on that (not all, obviously).

You certainly can participate actively in research with an MS, I still do even during residency. It all depends on your clinic's availability for that in my experience. Will you head a lab? Unlikely. But you can still do research, particularly clinically-focused projects. 

Honestly, if your focus and interest is clinical work and research doesn't interest you, find an MS program with a strong clinical component (there are quite a few regularly brought up here, off the top of my head: UPenn, LSU, U Kentucky) and you should be fine residency-wise. If you're still uncertain, CAMPEP requires programs to publish match rates every year for you to evaluate for yourself. Though the financial aspect of it is another factor to consider, any reputable PhD program will be funded, most MS programs are not (LSU is the one exception that comes to time, their program being 3 years).

Hope this helps.</p>
>><p>I think this is a fair comparison, but it’s worth mentioning that masters programs can get expensive. Alongside a salary bump a PhD program may also allow you graduate debt free (most, but not all, I’ve seen do waive tuition and pay a stipend). If you think you may want a PhD later in life either to head a lab, leave a clinic, or pursue admin positions, or if you’re just still unsure of the pros and cons, it may be worth looking at PhD programs that let you earn an en route masters degree. That way you can push off the decision until you’re a little bit more familiar with the field.</p>
>>><p>I think it is also good to note you can work as a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) or Teaching Assistant (TA) while doing your Masters. For me, a 27k/yr Masters tuition got cut to 4k/yr, alongside a $1600/month stipend for being a GRA (not adding all the MR experience I got). So Masters students can also get pretty much free college (at least be debt free) and a salary position, they would just have to look hard for it, specially if they want that work to be in the medical imaging field/therapy field.</p>
>>><p>As someone who originally got an (*expensive*) "ivy league" masters and is interested in pursuing a PhD post-residency, I couldn't agree more. I will say though, a PhD isn't a prerequisite for admin positions. My current clinical director is one of the best people Ive had the pleasure to work with and learn from, and he's an MS-level physicist. But yeah, I'm sure a PhD is significant help for that goal.</p>
