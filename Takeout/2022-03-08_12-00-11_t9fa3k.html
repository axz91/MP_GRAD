<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 03/08/2022</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

><p>As far as I know you will need some physics schooling. Medical physicists may work in medicine but they're still physicists, usually specializing in radiation or imaging physics. That's why most grad programs prefer students with a BS in physics, or at least a minor in it. Medical and biology courses are definitely a plus, but they aren't nearly as important as a strong background in mathematics and the physical sciences.</p>

>>><p>I know of several people that went into medical physics with an engineering BS, it’s totally doable! If your school has a nuclear engineering program then even better (you’ll be learning a lot about radiation physics in grad school), but an engineering degree in general should be more than sufficient to prepare you for the math and physics side of medical physics schooling. Go ahead and keep taking medicine/biology related courses as electives if those interest you, keep your grades in your math and physics courses high, and I see no reason why you shouldn’t qualify for a medical physics program.</p>
<p><b>Anyone know when UNLV makes decisions for their DMP program?</b></p>
<p><b>I already have a master's degree in medical physics but I only got a C+ grade point average so I'm told I'll need some work experience before I can get a registrar position. Since I'm a New Zealand citizen, I've usually only applied for NZ positions. My reasoning is that other countries need to extensively search for a local employee who already has citizenship or a visa before considering foreign recruits. Is this reasoning faulty?</b></p>
<p><b>Hey can anyone let me know what a standard wait time is for waiting to hear back after interviewing for a position?</b></p>
<p><b>Hello, I wanted to know about job prospects in the UK. I read in many articles that the field is saturated but most of them were about the US/CA. How is the job market in EU?

Also, Is there anyone who studied at Swansea uni? I am confused between Surrey and Swansea. I heard Swansea has better overall stats but the course is a bit heavy. On the other hand, Surrey has classes for like 3 days max in a week so there is time to catch up and take a breath if necessary.

Any answers would be appreciated</b></p>
<p><b>I was accepted into UChicago, UCLA, and UW Madison for their respective PhD programs. Although I think I know my top choice, I was wondering if anyone could talk about what they know about these schools. Specifically, the weaknesses at each program/school, overall vibe in the program (e.g cocky attitudes, easygoing, flexibility, etc.), social scene within the program, and resources that the program/university provides. Any other tips are welcome too since I’m still undecided. Thank you!!</b></p>
><p>First a disclaimer that I don't have any actual  experience  with any of these programs and don't know anything about UChicago.

Now that that's out of the way, the impression I got from UCLA was it seemed to be more research focused and less clinically focused. UW Madison seemed the opposite. In my interview (pre weird interview process they have) when I expressed interest in going into academia, the professor interviewing me said that their program focuses heavily on clinical medical physics and that other programs would be better for me. In an interview at another school with a professor that recently  graduated from Wisconsin I was also informed that Wisconsin has a very competitive, sometimes toxic atmosphere, which is not great.

Despite the clinical mill and competitive attitude,  if you want to do clinical  medical physics I'd suggest probably  that over UCLA.  Otherwise I got good vibes from UCLA and I'm sure their clinical program is good too.</p>
<p><b>Hi! New to medical physics field. What are some well known grad schools in this field? I looked at some online rankings but they seemed inconsistent.</b></p>
><p>[deleted]</p>
>><p>Would the 5 schools that you listed be good for both an MS or PhD?</p>
>>><p>[deleted]</p>
>>>><p>Is there any online resource that lists match rates out of each school? or only the universities will post them?</p>
>>>>><p>[deleted]</p>
>>>>>><p>Gotcha, I've seen stats regarding percentage of students that continue into residency but not stats of match rate. Thank you for all your help!</p>
>>>>>>><p>On the CAMPEP website, they have a public disclosure tab on the left side. They have reports from 2018-2020 of the residency rates for all the programs which makes it easier to see rather than going to all the individual programs websites to find the statistics.

>>>>>>>><p>Thank you!!</p>
<p><b>Anyone applied to Univ of Kentucky? Have you heard back?</b></p>
><p>If you mean post interview then no. I asked on Friday and they said we should hear back early this week but I guess it’s taking longer than anticipated</p>
<p><b>I got waitlisted at my top choice and was just looking for some insight. A lot of programs show many more offers than students matriculating, does that mean those schools went through their waitlist as well? Has anyone been waitlisted and willing to share the experience a bit? Thanks</b></p>
><p>Getting into undergrad I was waitlisted at MIT and applying for grad school I was waitlisted at UTSA last year. In my experience,  waitlisting is the worst. It gets your hopes up and there are high odds you won't get picked. From both schools I've been waitlisted for I never got a reply that they finally admitted everyone so if I just waited without accepting an offer for undergrad I would've been screwed. 

What I suggest is to wait until the last possible minute to accept any other offers though just in case, maybe even send out an email close to the deadline to your top choice to see if it is likely you'll  get in.</p>
>><p>Thank you!</p>
<p><b>Hello, I made a separate post , but can someone give me some insight to help me choose between UCLA and LSU. I got accepted into both PhD programs and I wanna know what they look like in terms of life - work balance, residency matching, prestige, etc.. thank you</b></p>
><p>About the programs themselves, I don't have much to add. But I do know UCLA has a fantastic reputation as a research university, but at the cost of the ridiculous cost of living in LA. My partner's sister goes there and has to pay $5,000 a month in rent for a 2 bedroom apartment  she shares with 4 other people. I don't doubt that you can find cheaper but it is definitely  one of the more expensive  areas you could live

(The $5,000 a month is split between all 5 of them so it's $1,000 each. I realized that is probably  unclear in my original  wording)</p>
<p><b>Hello,

I am currently waiting on decisions for PhD programs in Medical Physics for a few schools and wanted to know some thoughts and facts that I can't locate on these programs.

The only school I've been accepted to so far is University at Buffalo. It looks like funding is not given the first year, so I'd choose any school with funding over this at this point. Do any of you have any thoughts/opinions on their PhD program? Is it good? Would it be worth paying for the first year even if I get into somewhere else that funds me the first year?

The schools I am waiting for replies on are UMASS Lowell, University of Toledo, Duke, and Wayne State. In my interview I learned that Wayne State requires you to pay the first year, but it is also a great university for clinical medical Physics, although they specialize in Radiation and I want to go into imaging.

Does anyone know if University at Toledo, Duke, or UMASS Lowell fund you from the beginning? I think I saw that Duke and UMASS Lowell do, but confirmation is definitely not a problem. I also wanted to know your thoughts on these other schools. Duke is the only school I know I would for sure choose over the others, but more specifically I wanted to know about University of Toledo and UMASS Lowell as compared to University at Buffalo.

Hopefully some of you have some insight for me. Thank you in advance!!!</b></p>
><p>Have you heard anything from UMass Lowell? I applied as well and haven’t gotten any communication since</p>
>><p>I have heard nothing. No interview or anything. But I also didn't interview for Buffalo and was accepted in January. (They extended my decision timeline because they were so early)</p>
<p><b>Has anybody heard from Duke graduate program yet? I applied to MS Medical Physics for early decision and had interview on February but haven’t heard back from them yet</b></p>
><p>I heard back on the 15th of March last year, so maybe they send most final decisions  around that time. Hopefully  you hear back soon</p>
><p>Yes, I heard around a week after my interview in February. I would check the portal, as that was updated before I got the email.</p>
>><p>I just checked the portal and it still says submitted :(</p>
>>><p>If it was a no, you would have heard back by now. I'm guessing you're on the wait list, and Duke is still waiting on others to accept or decline their offer?</p>
>>>><p>Thanks for your reply, I just received the decision from them. Apparently they hesitated because of my undergrad courses.</p>
>><p>Did u apply to MS too or PhD?</p>
>>><p>I applied to MS as well.</p>
<p><b>As students and programs can now make their rank list, should I voluntarily e-mail all the schools I rank telling them that I did so? Are there any cons on doing that or just pros? 

I've gotten 4 e-mails from program directors saying they will rank me, should I reply saying I'll rank them as well (when I actually do, of course)? Should I also sent intentet emails to directors that hasn't sent me their intent?</b></p>
><p>Personally, I’d skip on the replies. When they say they will rank you, they’ve likely already made up their mind on how their rank list is organized, which can include 20+ candidates. So it doesn’t exactly change how the algorithm will shake up, but rather your perception of it. I don’t see a benefit in replying. Do you like these programs? Rank away! Feeling very sus? Go with your gut.

When I went through the Match, I actually had several programs tell me they would not respond to any “thank you or intent emails” in order to keep the process as bias-free as possible. All you need to worry about is ranking based on your personal preference. That’s how the Match is supposed to work!</p>
>><p>I see, I wasn't too incline to send rank emails or reply to the intent ones to start with, as I think it would change anyone minds (i.e. rankings). Also, doubt there's 20+ on the list for imaging haha there was like 11 or so on the secondary interviews I went (if you count all the days for places that spreads outs their applicants)</p>
