<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 07/12/2022</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

><p>Hey, there’s actually a new thread for this next week, so you’ll probably want to ask there if you want a response</p>
<p><b>I am doing my 2nd year MSc in Medical Physics in part time in Asia while working full time. In my country, people just need a master degree in related field (eg. medical physics, physics) before they apply for residency. I have seen quite a lot of residents who have experiences in fixing linac/CT MRI.

My current job is not related to radiation or imaging, and I feel that it is a disadvantage for me. What would be your advices for me to prepare for residency if I do not have related exp?</b></p>
<p><b>On average, how much radiation is a therapeutic medical physicist exposed to a day?</b></p>
><p>Very little.</p>
>><p>How does it compare with the average daily amount of radiation that a normal person receives?</p>
<p><b>Has anyone graduated with an MSC or PhD in medical physics and works in biomedical engineering? Is that an option?</b></p>
><p>What realm of biomedical engineering? Are you thinking big companies? Startups? Medical physics is kind of a weird field that isn't really engineering and isn't really science but many companies can't be fussed about the exact nature of your grad school research unless it applies exactly.</p>
<p><b>Is it possible to be able to study full time the MS medical physics program while working part- time (10-20 hrs) on campus? Is it doable to juggle school and work? How much time do you have for your own personal activities and time?</b></p>
><p>Maybe; more so if you work weekends. Many programs recommend you not work part time because they want you to focus on your graduate work. The thinking behind it is because shortly after you finish your coursework, you will be working in the field full time making okay-ish money (as a resident). If you have free time during the week, it's better spent shadowing physicists or working in the clinic if you are able. This will help you out when it's time to Match.

I worked as a TA/Instructor in the Physics department 15-20 hr/wk while I was in Grad School for Medical Physics. Several other classmates did as well. It added a lot of work that many other classmates didn't have to endure and ultimately put me behind. I didn't finish top of my class, but it all worked out for me. I matched to my #1 and then found a job fairly easily after residency. I do think I would have had more options (interviews) with better grades.

So just remember to put your graduate studies before your job. If you're going to be a medical physicist, then remember to focus on that as your career. If you can manage a job and be successful in your coursework, more power to you.</p>
<p><b>For 2023 ABR part 1, I heard they were doing an exam in January and August. The application period for both are August 1st to September 30th. I hope I pass in January but if I don't would I be able to take it in August? If I had to guess after looking through the website, it seems like you'd have to pick one.</b></p>
<p><b>I'm concerned that I can't push myself to finish my PhD. 

So far, I've finished the additional course work, so it's just the research component. I have a first authorship and will have a second one in the coming months, both for MP-related works. I'll have other authorships that aren't related to MP. However, i need probably 2 more papers for the thesis i plan on doing. I've been working part-time for a local hospital's (which also has a residency program) dosimetry department for the past year.

I passed abr part 1 August 2019. I applied for residencies for the 2020 July starting date but didn't get a position. Had a couple in-person interviews at places local to me.

All things considered, I know I'll be in a good position for a residency once I finish, but I know I won't be able to finish for the upcoming cycle unless i get incredibly lucky and pick up the pace, so I'd have to wait for the next one. All in all, this feels like an incredibly long time of *not* being a physicist and it's hard to come to terms with some days.

Edit: the lab I work with is fantastic</b></p>
><p>I don't actually hear you saying that you're unhappy. If you are, then give serious consideration to quitting. If you're happy, then there's no race whatsoever.</p>
>><p>I don't think I'm quite as unhappy as I'm fearful that I'm not moving forward and will take more time finishing this than I'd like. It just feels like I'll be a fossil already if I were to take another year and a half to finish my PhD and then finish residency at 31</p>

It won't solve your problem, but at least you can laugh about other people spending 15 years in grad school!

But seriously, unless you have sick parents to support or something, there's no hurry. At some point you'll probably long for the days where you could really sink your teeth into a research project and give it the time it deserves.

If you are unhappy or find the financial aspect especially compelling, then do make serious consideration towards quitting. Sometimes having a solid alternative plan will help you decide whether it's worth continuing. Unfortunately since residencies aren't that easy to come by it's a little complicated to hedge by applying to them and unclear what you should be promising about your academic status to each, but I'm sure there are plenty of ABDs out there doing great things!</p>
>>><p>"You're going to be 31 anyway, would you rather be 31 with your accomplishments or without?" is the best advice my mentor gave me. I'll be finishing residency at almost 30, and it's worth it for me.</p>
><p>You're not alone! I know people who are in a similar position as far as feeling like they're spending too long on their PhD and just want to move on. I even had this feeling towards the end of my MS, when it was unclear if I would finish on time. One thing that helped me was talking to a professor who wasn't on my committee about how I was feeling. He helped put things in perspective and figure out an action plan of how to get through the last six months of my program. As long as you're reasonably happy with your research project it sounds like you're on a good track, just remember that you've already come a long way which is something to be proud of by itself.</p>
<p><b>I'm a 2nd year PhD student in a BME/Med Phys program doing research in fMRI methods and cognitive neuroscience. I read through this subreddit and see all of these clinical questions and always wonder: when did you all start gaining clinical knowledge/experiences? Was it during your degree program, through your research, or all during residency? I guess I'm just wondering how much clinical knowledge I should aim to have before residency, and how much I should focus on my research relative to trying to secure clinical shadowing experiences. Thanks in advance!</b></p>
><p>The majority of your clinical knowledge and experience will come from the residency program (that's the purpose of the residency).  Clinical exposure during grad school is nice and if you have the opportunity to get some clinical time in, go for it.  Your focus for grad school should be your research and learning the fundamentals of medical physics.</p>
<p><b>Is it possible to move/work in Europe after going to grad school in the US? I have an EU passport and am thinking about moving to Europe after finishing my PhD but not sure how that would work with certifications.</b></p>
><p>Things are very different between the different countries in how open they are to people coming in with foreign qualifications. I would imagine that as long as you have an expectation of doing some further training that a phd is a phd no matter where you get it, but e.g. a part 1 ABR pass won't do much for you.</p>
