<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 03/07/2023</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

<p><b>I asked this earlier but never got a reply, why exactly is Umanitoba‚Äôs MP program considered bad for getting residencies?</b></p>
<p><b>Residency directors - do you care if an applicant says they plan on ranking you after interviews?</b></p>
><p>IANARD but I do work closely with one. Short Answer...Yes. 

Alternate answer: I wouldn't care personally but I know several residency directors that do and I don't think it hurts at all to send the email.</p>
<p><b>Hey everyone! I am urgently searching for someone who is currently a student at UT Health Science Center San Antonio's Doctorate of Medical Physics (DMP) program, or someone who graduated from that program.

Please respond, students, or connect me with someone like that! Thank you.</b></p>
><p>I‚Äôve seen you ask this question a couple times and it‚Äôs very possible no one in this sub came from that program or knows anyone that did. I was just remarking to my friend at AAPM last year that I had never met a DMP in the wild and he agreed. It is a pretty rare degree.</p>
>><p>Yeah, man. I‚Äôm trying my luck bc it‚Äôs rlly imp to talk to students from there, etc. Good. üëç</p>
>>><p>You will probably have better luck reaching out to the program directly.</p>
>>>><p>Yeah man, I‚Äôm trying my luck in all ways lol.</p>
>>>>><p>I'm late to this but I applied to the program and know a few graduates from the program. One of my research advisors is on the admissions committee there and I've been pretty involved with the program there.</p>
>>>>>><p>Nice! Would love to talk more abt this.</p>
<p><b>I am unable to post a poll so is anyone up to make one that is about residency matching for MS holders that list:

Matched 1st try (MS only)

Matched 2nd, 3rd, or 4th try (MS only)

Went into PhD after not matching

Went into PhD without even trying for a residency

Still trying to match, and/or in industry

See results

&#x200B;

Or does anyone have data similar to this as far as matching goes with a masters?

I still can't gauge of how risky it is going into MP with MS only. I've seen the stat that there is a 6 out of 7 chance for competitive applicants but thats for all MS applicants not only fresh grads.

I also think a poll on what kind of industry positions MS holders have would be very informative.</b></p>
><p>[https://www.campep.org/2021AnnualGraduateReport.pdf](https://www.campep.org/2021AnnualGraduateReport.pdf) 

Page 17. You're worrying too much, and that's coming from me, a big worrier.</p>
>><p>That document doesn‚Äôt break it down by applicants who were accepted on their first try. The same applies for CAMPEP and the MedPhys Match. Almost like they are hiding something‚Ä¶ Also a poll is a bad idea and part of the unfounded optimism. Those who did not match and left the field are most likely not on this forum. (survivorship bias)

I got my MSMP thinking it would be easy to get a residency. In my experience, none of my peers got a residency despite high GPAs and passing the ABR. Getting accepted into a PhD was much easier. Becoming a medical physics assistant to build experience is another path, but these are also competitive, can require a commitment before you know your match results, and are another 2 years of not making good money.

If I were you, I would ask for the first time match rate at schools you are interested in. In addition, I would contact recent MS alumni to see what their experience was and what went right or wrong. Some universities like LSU and Kentucky guarantee residencies too. You‚Äôre already smarter than me for asking this question, so maybe you have a shot.</p>
>>><p>Ya say that stat is only like 30% of first time applicants getting in, less people would enroll in the MS programs which would make the Universities less money. Just a theory, but ya I stress so much about this because I‚Äôm not a fresh grad who‚Äôs only 21-22 years old who has there 20s to figure it out I‚Äôm 25 and want to pursue a secure field right now that can pay relatively soon and decent and this honestly might be too much of gamble. It‚Äôs just one of those things where a decision needs to be made.</p>
>>>><p>The residency was designed, in large part, to limit the supply of new medical physicists and protect the high salaries. The attitude I would take is to assume you will need a PhD or additional training unless proven otherwise. I definitely did not get my MS knowing the odds of getting a residency the first time around would be approaching 0%. Again, there are programs which guarantee a residency, so consider focusing on those if time and finances are a priority.</p>
>>>>><p>Ya it might be best for me to work in the mean time right now and only pursue MP if I get into one of the reliable programs or just send the program in my hometown (if I get in) and hope for the best and have a good back up plan. Thanks for the insight though, it really is helping me with making decisions right now.</p>
>>>><p>Campep doesn't track how many times an applicant applied. You're right that some programs aren't as forthcoming about how successful their applicants are on the first try, but Campep still does require that they compile and publicize data as to where their applicants go each year. Those are here: [https://www.campep.org/PublicDisclosure.asp](https://www.campep.org/PublicDisclosure.asp). I still think you're stressing too much about this;  I started my current MS program in my late 20s, am I too old for this in your opinion? Also, many PhD physicists are finishing their degrees and starting residency in their 30s, often with a child+spouse already as well. I think the anxiety you're feeling is coming from external sources rather than from the job market. I can only tell you about what I know about the field itself.</p>
>>>>><p>I am sorry if my anxiety is contagious, everyone can handle these things differently, it is most definitely due to my personal situation I have with my partner (she‚Äôs a handful lol but I love her) that it feels extra stressful right now. I‚Äôve never had a good job prior to applying so it seems like a bigger commitment to me but is what it is, I have lots of hope things will be ok it‚Äôs just trying to make the right decisions isn‚Äôt easy.</p>
>>>>>><p>Things that are really worth it in life (relationships, a good career, etc) are never easy; I don't think they're supposed to be, either. Best of luck to you regardless.</p>
>>>>>>><p>Truth. You as well, good luck with your matching when it comes, eye of the tiger.</p>
<p><b>Is there a way/software to practice treatment planning at home? (I am not talking actual data of a patient, just any simulation of a ct etc.)
Also could anyone suggest a detailed anatomy reference name for what we do, i found myself having a hard time during contouring to differentiate between the rectum and anal canal axially on ct. (The center i train in uses Monaco), as i come from a physics background.</b></p>
><p>There is a great website called econtour.org which helps me a lot with anatomical contouring. It‚Äôs free and they have MRI and CT based cases.</p>
>><p>I can't actually thank you enough for this honestly.</p>
<p><b>hello guys, just to play it safely , i decided to study electrical engineering , can i after completing electrical engineering study medical physics (ill be self studying physics in the mean time) is that possible . are there any dis advs?  thank u so much guys</b></p>
><p>Make sure you get the requisite courses that campep asks for.</p>
>><p> thank you for replying...  to be honest i went to their website and i couldn't find  the requisite courses, can you send me a link? thank you so much and i am  so sorry to disturb you</p>
>>><p>https://campep.org/GraduateStandards.pdf

You'll need to complete a graduate degree from a CAMPEP accredited program after whatever EE degree you're going to be getting.</p>
>>>><p>thank you so much i really appreciate it, do you recommend it though?</p>
>>>>><p>If you're set on going into medical physics, whether you get an undergrad degree in EE or Physics won't really matter.  Either one should get you the qualifications to get accepted to a CAMPEP accredited medical physics graduate program.  You'll need that for the next step of getting into a CAMPEP accredited residency.

This of course all assumes you're in the US or Canada.  If you're not, then CAMPEP doesn't matter.</p>
>>>>>><p>yup ill be traveling to Canada ,  but the problem is am not Canadian . notwithstanding the fact that i need TOFEL and those stuff as an international student, are there any other concerns, can i become a medical physicist given the fact that am international student who will study in a canadian university , thank u so much . i am really sorry if i am disturbing you</p>
>>>>>>><p>After looking at your post history, here's my advice: Go with EE or Physics.  At this point, it doesn't matter a whole lot.  Whichever undergrad degree you choose to go with, you've got 4 years to explore all the different fields, and summers to pursue research/internship opportunities in the areas you find interesting.</p>
>>><p>I hope someone can help out with this since i dont have them handy but a minor in physics should work.</p>
