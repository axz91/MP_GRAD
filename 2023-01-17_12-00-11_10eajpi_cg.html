<h1>[Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 01/17/2023</h1>
<p>This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
<li>"How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<h3>Comment 1:</h3>
<p>Are residency interviews asking for “an 8 minute presentation on the topic of your choosing” really just code for telling you to talk about your research??</p>
<p>No. They want to see the individual be able to communicate and demonstrate some competence, understanding, and interest in the field. It could show their understanding of the clinic or research, whether theirs or not. Candidates have presented their research, especially PhDs, but some master's students as well. Some have even presented research papers they had read. Others have talked about clinical development projects and their master's thesis to show some breadth. The focus should be on presenting oneself as clinically focused, from personal statement to interview to presentation. The programs applied to are fundamentally clinical training positions, even if they have lots of opportunity for research.</p>
<h4>Response 1:</h4>
<p>Pretty much. That's usually the easiest thing for prospective candidates to talk about anyway.</p>
<h5>Response 1.1:</h5>
<p>Ok cool, thanks. The doubt has been removed!</p>
