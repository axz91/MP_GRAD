Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 11/15/2022

Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If the user is just learning about the field and wants to know if it is something they should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on their mind.

Examples:

- "The user majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for them?"
- "The user can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
- "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
- "Masters vs. PhD"
- "How does the user prepare for Residency interviews?"

Comment 1:
The user is applying to grad schools for medical physics, 3 of them, all in the US (the user is in the US). One of their recommenders is a professor at the university where they got their bachelors of physics this spring and they were on quite good terms. The professor has asked them to draft their own letter of recommendation. It is assumed that the professor is quite busy because he runs a significant chunk of the physics research programs there, as well as teaching ALL of the junior and senior level undergrad labs, AND English is not his first language (he tends to struggle with grammar a bit despite being absolutely brilliant, and he's always struck the user as being a bit embarrassed that it's a barrier for him). Obviously, the professor will be able to add or edit the letter as he sees fit after the user has sent him the draft.

What points would be good for the user to include in their letter? Suggestions? Guides? The user has never done this before.

Response 1:
No specific response provided.

Comment 2:
The user asks about MS graduate programs that require job shadowing to incoming undergraduate applications instead of research. They want to know if there are any programs that value shadowing over research experience.

Response 1:
No programs require shadowing as a part of the application. It is stated that any program would value relevant research experience over shadowing.

Comment 3:
The user expresses their desire to pursue medical physics but has a few concerns/questions. They mention that they are 25 years old, have a BS in Exercise Science, and are pursuing a BS in Radiation Therapy. They have only taken introductory physics 1 and 2 (not calc based) and calculus 1, with no other physics courses. They are wondering about the best course of action since they believe they need the equivalent of a physics minor to be considered. They also ask about specific courses that are important and have the highest carryover. Lastly, they inquire if they will be able to work as a radiation therapist while pursuing their masters.

Response 1:
No specific response provided.

Response 2:
The user appreciates the advice and mentions that they have been speaking to a lot of the higher-ups at the clinic. They are weighing the pros and cons of med school vs med physics. They mention that they don't have an engineering background and they do like biology (memorization). They realize that medical physics will be just as long if not longer than med school in total.

Response 3:
The user asks if the commenter is set on doing medical physics or RT. They mention that it will take a lot of effort to change directions if the commenter has only taken non-calc based physics courses so far.

Response 4:
The commenter confirms that they are definitely set on medical physics. They understand that they have a lot of ground to make up and it is a long-term plan. They plan on working as an RT while taking prerequisites.

Response 5:
The commenter suggests that if the user is up for the increased workload of doing school while working, they can certainly do physics prerequisites at a local college. They mention the specific classes that may be required and suggest looking into Georgia Tech's online masters in medical physics if the user plans on working while doing their masters.

Comment 4:
No specific response provided.

Comment 5:
The user asks about the GPA in undergrad needed to get into a CAMPEP med phys school and the typical cost for grad school.

Response 1:
No specific response provided.

Comment 6:
The user, a clinical lab technologist with a background in biology, asks about the quickest way for them to get their foot through the door in the medical physics field. They inquire if there is a masters track they can take.

Response 1:
The commenter confirms that the user can definitely do a masters in MP. However, they mention that most programs require a full physics major/minor or specific classes. They advise checking the requirements of individual institutions.

Comment 7:
The user asks how far a PhD can get them in a clinical setting compared to a master's degree.

Response 1:
The commenter states that a PhD and a master's degree can get the user the same opportunities in a clinical setting. However, supervisor/leadership roles may be restricted to those with a PhD.

Comment 8:
The user shares their disappointment after finding out that they are not on the interview list for their dream job. They express their feelings of rejection and mention their plans to mope for a day before getting back at it.

Response 1:
The commenter expresses sympathy for the user's situation and assures them that a different opportunity will come up in the future.

Comment 9:
The user, a CMD helping to teach a Dosimetry class to Radiation Therapy students, seeks feedback and ideas for improving the class.

Response 1:
The user asks physicists in Radiation Oncology for their perspective and ideas on concepts that therapists should have a greater understanding of regarding treatment planning and clinical dosimetry.
