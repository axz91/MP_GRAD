<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 10/05/2021</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

<p><b>I’m currently an undergrad nursing major but am heavily considering changing majors. I have a bunch of questions, mostly about the actual day-to-day of being a medical physicist. I know there’s a lot so any answers you could give me would be greatly appreciated.
1. How much time do you spend at a desk vs being up on your feet?
2. How involved are you in determining treatment? Do you just check the MD orders are possible, or are you actively involved in treatment decisions?
3. Do you actually perform procedure?
4. How much interaction do you have with patients?
5. It seems like the vast majority of medical physics is radiation oncology based. What if any, other areas are there?
6. What made you decide to go into medical physics, as opposed to other science or medical fields? Are you happy with your decision?</b></p>
><p>I'm an assistant so I can't properly answer your other questions, but for 5: imaging physics is the other "major" branch of clinical medical physics, and it is growing in importance in practice as more and more image guidance is used in medical procedures, including radonc. Any MRI, CT, X-ray, ultrasound, nuc med, mammography scan or procedure ever has had a diagnostic physicist's input in it, directly or indirectly.</p>

><p>The general consensus on this sub is no wrt to DMP being worth it (it being money in most contexts).</p>
<p><b>Adding to a question is this thread: Does applying early to residency increases your chance of matching, or at least getting an interview? I plan to apply between Oct 15-30 (application cycle starts Oct11)</b></p>
<p><b>Are applications in the med phys residency match processed on rolling admission? (Like how med school apps are)</b></p>
><p>I don't think they are. You should watch this: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvgfgGmemdA)</p>
<p><b>Can anyone speak on the quality of Hofstras MS program?</b></p>
<p><b>Are there any PhD programs that include Proton therapy research? I am finishing my MS this year while also working at a proton center, and I’ve realized I want to learn more about protons and focus my PhD on proton therapy. However I know that there are not many proton centers so it has been difficult to find solid programs that also have proton research opportunities.</b></p>
><p>I would start by cross referencing places that have proton therapy and places that have a CAMPEP program. Also look at publications and see where the authors are. For instance Mayo clinic has a lot of proton therapy research but their PhD program isn't CAMPEP.</p>
<p><b>[deleted]</b></p>
><p>Medical physics assistant positions usually just require a bachelors in a physical science or engineering, but positions like that are not plentiful.</p>
<p><b>Is it possible to switch research interest during your med phys career? I'm applying to graduate programs this year and trying to narrow down my research interests. I will probably stick to something in radiation therapy for my graduate thesis. I'm also interested in brachytherapy and radiation biology research. Will I be pinned to radiation therapy for my entire career if I choose to write my graduate thesis on radiation therapy?</b></p>
><p>Take my advice with a grain of salt since I don't have decades of experience like many others here do.

That said, in my experience, absolutely not lol. In general, being able to switch your research focus is mainly a function of heaving access to the resources and training wherever you work/study. I personally did my MS thesis in a topic related to cardiac SBRT, but thanks to the help of my programs faculty, I'm now doing research in mainly photodynamic therapy, with some potential cherenkov imaging stuff down the line. Of course, there are some caveats regarding clinical work, rather than research. Mainly, if you want to do clinical imaging work after getting certified in therapy physics, you'd need to go through an imaging residency, stuff like that. 

But as far as research goes, in my experience, it's all about having access to the right people and resources to get your foot in the door.</p>
>><p>This was very helpful! Thank you!</p>
<p><b>Are there any graduate schools with a big focus on computational research, especially artificial intelligence? So far I've found that UChicago and MD Anderson both have a few people who do that type of research, but wasn't sure if there were any other schools that "specialize" in that type of research (and by specialize, I mean more than one or two faculty members).</b></p>
><p>For UChicago, you should specifically look at Maryellen Giger's lab. Not only is she a leader in the field of computer-aided diagnosis but she's a wonderful mentor and goes to bat for her trainees. She's an awesome person to have in your network (former AAPM president, former SPIE president, has successful experience with startups).

I wasn't even in her lab but I could tell from her students how great of a group it is.</p>
><p>I’m part of the Center for Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers ([CVIB](https://cvib.ucla.edu)) at UCLA and we do lots of stuff with AI. There’s 5 faculty part of the group that deal with both CT and MRI image processing that implements AI in different ways. 

If you’re interested in therapy applications of AI, then there’s lots of labs at UCLA that focus on that like Ke Sheng, or for neuroscience applications look at Allan McKenzie Graham or David Shattuck. Dan Ruan also does a lot of computational research and modeling/simulating I think. 

PM me if you’d like to know more about the program at UCLA!</p>
><p>Check UT Southwestern. They have a huge AI research group.</p>
><p>The centers you listed are big names and probably have a decent number of people working on AI, however I think it'll be a stretch to say that any one place "specializes" in AI research.</p>
