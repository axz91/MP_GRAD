<p><b>Transition from Dosimetrist to Physicist

Hello! I have been a dosimetrist for close to 7 years now and my current employer would like me to consider the idea of becoming a junior physicist. 

I have always thought I would entertain the idea to become a medical physicist one day, but never have pursued the thought. I realize there is a much larger responsibility/expectation of becoming a physicist compared to taking on a junior physicist role. 

I really enjoy my job as a dosimetrist, but I also feel like I havenâ€™t hit my own professional ceiling. 

Do you have any advice or past experience for someone who is looking to make this jump?

Thank you for all responses!</b></p>
