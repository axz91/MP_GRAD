<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 02/28/2023</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

<p><b>What exactly is the issues with The University of Manitoba’s MP program? People always shit on it here without elaborating so I dont understand what exactly makes it so bad.</b></p>
<p><b>Hey guys! Any one here from the DMP program at UT Health San Antonio? 

I’d really appreciate someone like that because I’d like to ask students from there, specific questions about the program, etc., as I’m genuinely interested in that specific program.

Thank you. Please let me know.</b></p>

<p><b>What are medical physics residency programs that they are accepting international students visa F1?</b></p>
><p>For clarification, are you asking about the medical physics residency programs that do not accept F1 visa types?</p>
>><p>Yes, that what I mean</p>
>>><p>A lot of residency programs accept applicants with OPT F1 visa. It’s just a handful that do not accept applicants with OPT F1 visas. Also you can check the residency websites and they might have informations about types of visas that will be accepted. You can also contact the program director</p>
<p><b>Are salaries on the rise in medical physics? I saw a post discussing how places are raising starting salaries due to desperation. Would love more enlightenment on that</b></p>
><p>Seems like it... demand and supply basics, there's a lot of demand for a short supply, prices are being inflated in all levels (entry or +)</p>
<p><b>Also, guys: Is anyone at UT Health Science Center San Antonio’s DMP program or can connect me with someone there? I want to know more about it.</b></p>
<p><b>[My Post] Prospective Student Pondering Over Medical Physics:

Hey guys! I am a student done with undergrad now. I was a pre-med but am now strongly considering Medical Physics as a career. I am especially interested in a "Doctorate of Medical Physics" which is at an institution near me.

So, can someone please give me an overview of a career in Medical Physics? Is getting a Doctorate beneficial in all ways, over just a Master's? Also, how is the career lifestyle and salary outlook (e.g., how long can you expect to start hitting $200K after graduating with your Doctorate, which included your residency)?

Thank you. Awaiting your replies.</b></p>
><p>In my opinion, as a Master’s level physicist, a DMP is no different from a Master’s and a residency. That’s because it is the exact same training except you have to pay for all 4 years for the DMP while the MS + Residency has you earning a salary as a resident.

I would strongly suggest if you want to be called Dr. Ali_Perfectionist, to get a PhD. Your opportunities as a PhD medical physicist are limitless whereas a DMP only really gives you the advantage of confusing some HR person thinking it’s anything different from a masters level physicist. All the people making the hiring decisions will know it’s nothing special. 

There is a caveat however, being accepted into the DMP program does mean you won’t have to do a residency which means you won’t have to Match. If you at all worry about that, and the lack of pay isn’t a concern, a DMP program is a huge relief. Many of the DMP programs offer a good clinical experience (from my knowledge of them) so you will get quality training there. I’m sure if you were to ask a MS physicist who didn’t match for a couple years if they wish they would just have done a DMP instead I bet many would say yes. 

In summary: get a PhD if you like research and want all opportunities open for your career and are prepared to spend 5-7 years more in school. Get a Master’s if you want to become a clinical medical physicist for the least cost and start earning a salary soonest but knowing you have to compete in the match. Go DMP route if you aren’t worried about the cost for 4 years and don’t want to worry about being matched.</p>
>><p>I would like to know more! I really wanna do a DMP due to job opportunities being easier, me wanting the highest-level degree in a field, and having a “Dr.” in my name!</p>
>>><p>I will say job opportunities as a DMP will NOT be any different than a masters level. If you want easier job opportunities do a PhD. If you want the highest-level degree in our field do a PhD. If you want people in our field to respect the Dr. in your name become an MD and be a radiation oncologist, or, at the very least, also get a PhD. If you want to impress your family and neighbors and don’t want the commitment of getting a PhD or MD then go for the DMP. But if you go in thinking  the DMP is the penultimate of medical physics degrees then you will realize soon after that it is not.</p>
>>>><p>Nice, nice. I get you. But I’m sure the DMP helps a lot as the Residency is already integrated and you don’t have to compete for big stakes, no? I’m sure there are more pros to the DMP.

Don’t you think it has the better future and that Master’s MP programs will become extinct because DMPs will become more valuable as the Doctoral degrees and guaranteed residencies + more money-making opportunities for educators?</p>
>>>>><p>A DMP is NOT a doctoral degree.  Some programs created it specifically to make a ton of money during both the MS and residency, rather than having to pay residents.  There are 5 programs with a DMP.  I doubt there will be many more.</p>
>>>>>><p>Hmmm. But it’s a “Doctorate” level degree. I totally understand the money part but isn’t it still a very valuable degree?</p>
>>>>>>><p>I've only seen 1 DMP in my life. PhD and MS physicists? Dozens. If they were actually that valuable, then there would be a lot more DMPs, and the number of DMP programs would be increasing, rather than being stagnant like they are right now.</p>
>>>>>>>><p>Noted. Thank you!</p>
>>>>>>><p>As the fifth person to say this: DMP is basically a way for you to PAY to have a MASTERS degree plus a Residency. The Bonus: Not going though the Match. The price: Paying for residency, while non-DMP MASTERS students gets paid (\~60k/yr).

In the end of the DMP program you are gonna sit on the table with all the Masters student, you WILL NOT sit on the table with PhDs.</p>
>>>>>>>><p>Hmmm good. I know. I'm trying to understand more. So, by sitting on the table, you mean in terms of job opportunities, DMP grads would be more similar to Master's peeps?

Any other pros of DMP? Like, with board certification help, etc? And having a "Doctorate" in some field? Please, I'm only trying to discuss and learn more!

Also, any podcasts/YouTube channels you'd recommend I listen to and watch, to gain more understanding of the Medical Physics field and the subject matter it covers, lifestyle, etc?</p>
>>>>>>>>><p>Yes, DMPs are on the same level as a Master student that completed residency, only difference is that the DMP doesn't have to fight for a residency spot, while masters students have to go though the match (but get a salary).

DMP with board certification equals a master with board certification. The real only PRO of DMP is that you have a guaranteed residency position. That's it. You go though 2 years of schooling (like masters students) and then 2 years of residency. In DMP you are paying for 4 years of school while Masters only pays for 2 years and then get a 60k/yr average salary during residency.

The "Doctorate" name is really misleading, as it does not open ANY single door for you in the future. I believe it was more of a Marketing strategy by the programs, to not have to pay a salary for residents. SO even though it sounds better, it is not. I don't see any pros of doing DMP.

I don't know of any podcast/youtube channels. I follow subreddit and talked with professionals in my institution about med phys and the different tracks.</p>
>>>>>>>>>><p>Thanks a lot. Got it. I am still researching and will keep on doing so.</p>
>>>>>>>>>><p>Hormesis podcast and and Out of the Gray podcast are the only two I am aware of. They are both radonc focused.</p>
>>>>>>>>>>><p>Nice! Thanks! Do they have MPs talking too/do they talk about MP?</p>
>>>>>>>>>>>><p>You can always google them and find out yourself, fyi.</p>
>>>>>>>>>>>>><p>Yeah but I prefer to talk to real ppl. I was trying to find the full part of the latest “MS vs DMP vs PhD” episode but couldn’t..</p>
>>>>>>><p>I think three people have already told you this, so I will just repeat it a fourth time so it's extra clear and there's no chance of confusion:  A DMP is NOT considered a PhD-equivalent.  It will not give you the same opportunities as a PhD (principal investigator of a lab, professor title at an academic center, etc).  As far as I understand, there are no expectations of a thesis defense, thesis publication, general publication, and overall academic research skill development.</p>
>>>>>>>><p>Alr alr, I get you. I am trying to understand. Maybe not an equivalent, but still a "Doctorate" level degree which grants you better opportunities and prestige? But I guess it's the same as a Master's + Residency.. 

Still, what I like is the fact that I will have a Doctorate in something (FYI: MDs have "Doctorates" in Medicine"); so, at least I will have had the highest degree in a specific field. But I'd love to talk and learn more!</p>
>><p>Thank you so much for this. Can we talk more? Via chat or Insta?</p>
>>><p>You can DM me here if you want. Or feel free to respond. I’m an open book on this topic.</p>
>>>><p>Perfect. Tysm. I really want to meet more ppl in this field and discuss, as not many ppl are MPs. Good. Let’s talk more.</p>
<p><b>I am 25 freshly graduated with a physics degree looking for a good career and think medical physics is a really awesome route. My partner of 7 years is worried (and me too) about the risks of going into MP(job location in a city we don't love or is unsafe, at least 4 year commitment to a very niche job, starting a family during studies and residency, ect.) and she'd be at more at ease if I could try to land a good tech job with more flexibility. I know at the end of the day it's my life and I can pursue my dream job if I want but she is the biggest part of my life so I want to do what's best for us. I am very open to advice on my situation because I need to make a choice sooner or later after I (hopefully) get accepted into a MS program for this fall. I know there is uncertainty with any career, I really just want more insight on the situation so I can make a better informed decision. 

\-Has anybody been with a partner and/or had a kid throughout their entire MP journey? If so how has that been? I'm guessing it is not easy lol 

\-If I do not match my first round after a MS what are my odds of getting in the next round of matching? 

\-What are my options if I do not match my first round?

\-How hard are the board exams, where can I find the statistics of the pass/fail rates, do most pass first time after residency?

\-I am hoping that down the line I can be in a good city (I obviously won't be too picky), do a lot of medical physicist end up in cities they are not that happy with?

\-How does a city that is not your favorite affect your overall life and happiness? 

\-Will most medical physicist stay at their first position in what ever city until they finally get hired in their dream city and then look to buy a home? If so how long does it take (on average) to get into a dream city?

\-How secure is a MP job, if I land a job in my dream city can I buy a home confidently knowing I can stay at the hospital or institution for 20+ years? 

\-Do you get two weeks travel as a MP?

\-Can you go on small weekend trips as a MP, or do you need to always be stationed incase of an emergency with a machine?</b></p>
><p>Some of your questions are pretty broad but I'll do my best to answer

* I've been with my partner since starting my MP grad program 3 years ago (part time) while working full time. It's not easy but I think that is generally true for grad school. Of note, all of the female MPs (who are underrepresented in the field, obviously) that I have met have kids.
*  That depends on what you do between cycles. If you work on research or otherwise build your CV actively, then it should be higher. If not, probably lower since committees won't be impressed if wasted your time instead.
* Obviously, you'd have to get a job to be able to feed yourself. Ideally, you'd land a job that is in medical physics (like physics assistant position), but these can be hard to find. Otherwise, get a job that utilizes skillsets that are broadly applicable to MP (software, etc). 
* [Part 1 data](https://www.theabr.org/medical-physics/initial-certification/part-1-exam/part-1-exam-results) [Part 2 data](https://www.theabr.org/medical-physics/initial-certification/part-2-exam/part-2-exam-results) [Part 3 data](https://www.theabr.org/medical-physics/initial-certification/part-3-exam/exam-results)
* Too broad and personalized a question to answer imo. What works for you may not work for other people. Anecdotally right now is a good time for job applicants but if there is a specific city that you have in mind it isn't guaranteed that there is an opening there.
* Again this is a personal question that I can't answer for you, per se.
* Not at that point in my career, so I can't answer this either so I'll let others chime in.
* MP is pretty secure, people I've heard that change jobs are changing because they wanted to rather than being fired etc. Some stay 20+ years like you mentioned.
* Salaried MP jobs ought to have 2 weeks PTO minimum, and most likely probably more than that. I wouldn't work somewhere that doesn't offer it. I can't say if locums physicists get that, never worked with one. 
* Some places might have you on weekend call. If this is the case, it wouldn't be every weekend. Not sure if this is the case for physicists that are solo at a clinic, although a lot of places don't treat on weekends anyways. 
* This is a great resource regarding residency chances: [https://www.campep.org/PublicDisclosure.asp](https://www.campep.org/PublicDisclosure.asp)</p>
>><p>Thank you for the info, you’re right some of those questions are too vague but those are just some of the things I’m worrying about the most right now. 

What kind of program are you in and how is it working full time and school part time? 
I didn’t know that was an option actually, do most schools give that kind of flexibility? 

I want to work part time during my MS but id be worried that my grades will suffer.</p>
>>><p>I'm finishing up the Georgia Tech MS program, it's the only CAMPEP MS that's offered fully\* online. There are 2 weekends you have to come to campus (Atlanta) for labs. I started working as a medical physics assistant a couple years before applying. It's definitely tough working and doing classes afterwards, but I think it has worked out for me personally. If you have a job right now you might benefit from doing the GT program, but it sounds like you already applied to an in person program and are just waiting to hear back if I'm not mistaken.</p>
>>>><p>Oh that’s super cool they do that, so can I live in another city and just fly down for labs? I’m applying next month to an instate school and want the cheaper tuition but I saw that the deadline for Georgia tech is May so I might apply but i think it’s too late to apply for financial aid so might try next year if I don’t get into the school I want. We’ll see, thanks for sharing though, my fiancé would love it if I could work as well as school lol</p>
<p><b>What are the average weekly hours?</b></p>
><p>For grad school or residency?  I'm going to guess both are regularly close to 40 hours a week, but there will be occasions when it's more, possibly much more.</p>
>><p>In residency, I find it depends *heavily* on the rotation and whatever is going in the clinic. Ive done everything from 45hrs to 60hrs (thinking weeks with lots of early-morning brachy cases with machine QA/PSQA responsibilities, among other things). Though the latter end of that spectrum is certainly not super common. Usually it's 45-50 hours. Physicists are usually less in my residency, but they do have some long days on occasion (especially when there's high patient load).</p>
<p><b>Is being a medical physicist draining? In relation to working hours</b></p>
><p>Sometimes, but any job can be like that. Just depends on your workplace and coworkers.</p>
<p><b>How often do former healthcare workers (radiology tech or nurse) pursue this path if they were just to take a couple of pre reqs before applying? Trying to balance the idea of if this is financially worth it</b></p>
><p>I knew a few back before the CAMPEP residency requirement.  Now it seems to be more rare, I suppose because spending 4 years as a trainee is a higher bar than spending 2 years as a trainee.</p>
><p>In the US, if your goal is to be a board certified medical physicist, your path is going to be a CAMPEP accredited graduate degree (Master or PhD) followed by a CAMPEP accredited residency program.  

Acceptance criteria for graduate programs vary, but probably will require at least a Bachelor's degree in physics or some related field.</p>
><p>I’m sure some exist, but it’s pretty rare. Most programs are going to require something like a BS in physics, and it’s unlikely that a Rad Tech or nurse would have taken those necessary pre-reqs.  

Sorry if I didn’t answer your question. I wasn’t quite what it was asking.</p>
>><p>You can always take them after graduating. Thought about taking a couple of extra physics courses but chemistry was not my strong point</p>
>>><p>Yep, it’s certainly possible.  I’ve heard of dosimetrists becoming physicists, but there’s no reason someone else from a different medical field couldn’t too.</p>
>>>><p>I mean it didn’t matter what field they were from. I was just interested in medical diagnostic imaging physics (rad background) and was willing to maybe see if I can be reimbursed for a couple of extra pre reqs but I’m not sure if I would even qualify for a program or if it’s worth it to go into. Pay for physics is great but then I gotta take on debt/not work while I’m school</p>
<p><b>[deleted]</b></p>
><p>* Are you just applying to the 1 program? A 3.6 physics GPA is very good, especially from a program like Berkley. I'd say your chances are decent to get into a few places but you only mentioned the one program.  If you are geographically tied to your hometown that will lower your chances somewhat. 
* The GRE is basically just a checkbox, no need to fret about it (if it is even asked for in the first place). I haven't seen any programs require the physics GRE (others please correct me if I'm wrong). 
* Add the research experience if you feel like you can meaningfully talk about what you learned from it, even if it just organization and lab skills. That's the *real* purpose of undergrad research imo. I don't know of many places that have research assistant positions in medical physics labs, but that's just because we're a bit of a niche field.
* If you want to be successful, best to know why you want to apply to a medical physics grad program, and that requires that you know why you want to be a medical physicist. You said that you made the choice recently: what made you make the choice? Why choose it over the many fields you can take a physics bachelors in? Plenty of my classmates went straight to lucrative software jobs right out of college. Not trying to ask you pointed questions here to be an ass, it's just that you can only convince an admissions committee if you can first convince yourself. Shadowing should help you a lot with that answer.</p>
>><p>Thanks for this reply, definitely giving the field lots of thought. Actually just landed a research assistant role in MP, it’s volunteer only unfortunately, but should help my CV.</p>
<p><b>I'm in my 2nd semester of my 1st year of grad school (Master's) in medical physics, coming from a physics background(Bachelor's in pure physics). Is it just me or am i right when i'm feeling like i'm not really taking any advanced or theoretical physics/mathematics, so things so far feel very applied, mathematically easy, and not really that complicated, is something wrong?</b></p>
><p>You're more likely to use more of your math and physics background in nuc med and diagnostic imaging, especially if you go into research.

On the other hand, without the understanding you gained as an undergraduate of how things work in classical mechanics, E&M, etc., you would likely find the graduate coursework much harder.  You're implicitly using what you learned in UG to understand and organize how to solve problems in grad school.</p>
>><p>To begin with, thanks for your insightful reply.
Honestly i agree, physics did prepare me for more advanced problem solving skills. I think i'm going to be pursuing something related to radiotherapy and treatment planning, as it is the main route available at the place i am currently, in addition to me really loving it. 
Which field would you think has better prospects for the future work wise?</p>
><p>[deleted]</p>
>><p>Yes exactly, most of the things/courses i studied and learned in physics seem mostly useless applied in the field, except some headlines here and there plus some nuclear physics. But all in all having a degree in physics makes you way more comfortable dealing with many aspects you face, only downside with physics is that you should totally read and study more anatomy and human biology on your own, it starts as a natural weak point with you.</p>
><p>Almost everyone I've talked with in graduate programs all agree that their graduate program material is much easier than their undergrad material. So I think how you feel seems to be very common.</p>
>><p>That is certainly the case, very reassuring to hear that. Undergrad material in some cases felt really harder.</p>
>>><p>Yes, I'm very encouraged by this as I am in my last semester of undergrad and start my masters in the fall.</p>
><p>No, it's ok. This field requires other skills to prioritize, like attention to details, concentration on routine details, communication skills ..  If you are looking to be on first frontier of theoretical physics - wrong direction, for sure.</p>
>><p>Thanks for the insights! 
I love the field and major so far, things are really interesting and self rewarding. But i thought something was off from my own university, as it is a new and very rare field in my country.</p>
