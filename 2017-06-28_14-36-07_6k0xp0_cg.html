<h1>Career Question: Women with a Family in Clinical Med Physics?</h1>
<p><strong>Post Content:</strong> I am interested in a career in clinical medical physics. However, I am a woman and do hope to have a family. My significant other also works in healthcare and will work full-time normal hours as well. What are the experiences with raising children/having a family with a clinical career? When did they decide to have children? With the residency requirement, it is hard to decide when is best to do so.</p>

    <p><strong>Comment 1:</strong> If the user works in Canada, they will get year-long maternity leaves (going to be 1.5 soon), and there are few individuals who work significantly more than 40 hours/week unless they want to.</p>

    <p><strong>Comment 2:</strong> The user agrees with everyone else here. They had their first kid just after starting their first job, and their second kid 2 years after. They use conventional daycare/school with after school program, and take turns with their spouse in drop offs and pick ups. They still travel a few times a year. But like ericvt says, there are trade-offs, and they have to learn to accept them (not easy at times). Any time is as perfect as any other to have kids!</p>

    <p><strong>Comment 3:</strong> A clinical diagnostic medical physicist who has two children, currently ages 7 and 9, shares their experience. Their son was born towards the beginning of their residency, and their daughter was born almost a year after they finished their residency. They mention that there is no perfect time to have a child, but there are ways to make it work while still having a fulfilling career. They have had times when their kids have come to work with them off-hours and have sat through some of their lectures. They offer to discuss more and share their experiences.</p>

    <p><strong>Comment 4:</strong> On average, it is a 40-50 hour/week job which is typical for any white collar profession. However, one can end up working longer if they don't carefully schedule things to work around clinical hours. Happiness will depend on organizational skills and the employer's expectations. It is mentioned that the commenter is a guy, but they believe it is doable.</p>

    <p><strong>Comment 5:</strong> The commenter knows plenty of people in the medical physics community who have young children and are raising them without issue. Some have full-time nannies, some have family that helps out, some use conventional daycare systems, and some have part-time jobs instead of full-time. It is mentioned that it is doable, with trade-offs on both sides.</p>
