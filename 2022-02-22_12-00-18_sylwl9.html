<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 02/22/2022</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

<p><b>I am going to be applying for medical physics a grad school this fall, I recently became interested in the field and I don’t really have research experience. I am a physics major going for an NRE minor (closest thing to medical physics here). Am I ok with a lack of research experience? I want to go into radiation therapy mainly.</b></p>
><p>Lack of research experience will certainly be a problem for PhD programs. Are you applying to masters?</p>
>><p>Yeah. My current school only offers a masters and I need a masters for radiation therapy afaik so my plan is to go for masters and then a PhD later down the line.</p>
>>><p>Having a masters would definitely help, especially if you publish with your thesis research. Looks like you go to Georgia Tech; they definitely have a PhD in medical physics (I am in the DL masters right now).</p>
>>>><p>Ah ok I must have missed it. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Does taking some courses like Radiation Physics and Radiation Protection as undergraduate student with some hours of medical physics job shadowing help to improve the application for applying to MS graduate programs?</b></p>
><p>For sure it would be good to have, although I don't think what exact electives you take matter as much as your grades in said electives. You'll get plenty of radiation physics and protection in a campep program so don't worry about getting a "leg up" if you get my drift.</p>
<p><b>Are CAMPEP accredited certification programs a realistic way for entry into medical physics in North America? Would they be able to compete with Medical Physics PhDs for residencies? I have been accepted to two PhDs (Geophysics and Medical Biophysics) and I like both fields equally. To me (maybe naïvely), starting a PhD in Geophysics and having the certification program as a back up seems a better idea, only if the certification makes me competitive for residencies and later on, hospital positions. 

&#x200B;

What would you suggest I do or how to view it?</b></p>
><p>Certificates for PhDs in fields other than MP is certainly realistic - plenty of people do it.  I’m a masters student with a few certificate classmates.  Our department has current and past residents who did the certificate.  During this residency interview season, I’ve met several residents at prospective programs that were certificate students.

As far as being a backup option: if it does end up the case you discover geophysics is not for you and you do a certificate, by the time of residency application, have a better narrative that describes why/how you switched to medical physics and want clinical training.  During our residency application coaching, they warn us that programs are on the look out for physicists who seemed like they were there because other fields just didn’t work out.  Some residencies themselves said the same thing during open houses and virtual residency fair before the application season.  They want indications that you really are interested in being a clinical medical physicist through things like shadowing, assisting in clinic and clinical projects etc.  

As a side note, those classmates who are doing a certificate have all done the certificate part-time over at least two years while working day jobs as researchers - mostly post docs in rad onc.  This seems like a good option since they get research experience in medical physics, have a bit more time (especially that interim summer) to do clinical stuff and they get tuition benefits as school employees.  

Another side note: consider the opportunity cost of going directly into a certificate route compared to a CAMPEP degree - you’d be delaying getting to a qualified medical physicist salary by a year or so.  But I guess that’s secondary if you’re truly on the fence about which field you want right now.</p>
<p><b>Will a new model be seen with the bottleneck currently in place?

Approximately many open positions are there in the US?

Does the current state of ABR/CAMPEP/Residency prevent these from being filled in a timely manner?

If these positions can’t be filled adequately, does that change or will it change the current model for staffing ie 1-2 FT physicists on site for consults, specials (eg HDR/seeds/SRS etc), another physicist doing remote chart checks, and another doing monthly QA for a site or system? More remote work, physicist assistants, automation?

Interested to hear thoughts. Thank you.</b></p>
><p>I work for a healthcare staffing agency and recently saw a job posting come through for a medical physicist (6 month contract position). Normally, facilities will only utilize hiring agencies when they are having trouble filling the position. So it would seem like the need is there..

It got me looking into what it would take to become board certified (I have a MS in physics) and have been a little discouraged by what it would take. Another masters degree in MP, plus a residency where most programs accept just 1 applicant a year.</p>
><p>The bottleneck is to your benefit.

Would you rather be able to easily get a residency position but struggle to find employment afterwards, when you are more specialized and have already committed more  years of your life to a profession in which you are not competitive?

Do you want there to be so many candidates that employers feel no pressures to offer good working conditions or competitive salaries?

Be careful what you wish for. The bottleneck is the main reason you are interested in this position to begin with.</p>
>><p>Not me. I’ve been doing this for 25 years. The number of years required has become absurd IMO and the numbers on the boards don’t reflect the intent of CAMPEP etc.</p>
>>><p>That has grown with the number of prospective applicants, not in isolation.

Look at our colleagues in “real physics” trying to get jobs in academia, and tell me we should widen the bottleneck</p>
>>>><p>I'm in favor of ending the bottleneck and integrating residencies into the master's degree. While the bottleneck certainly increases salaries, employers are overpaying for medical physicists. This encourages overworking and a search for alternatives. In the future, we'll see less jobs and demand for medical physicists which mitigates the initial advantages. Finally, the residency bottleneck is pushing people into PhD's, MPAs, or away from medical physics after investing in the field. The opportunity cost of a PhD could easily be $500k in lifelong earnings. MPA isn't as bad, but there is also a chance you don't get it the second time around.

If there is to be a bottleneck, it should be in grad school admissions. The strong possibility of wasting 2 years and $100k on a masters degree (over 50% at many programs) when you could have been starting a career in another field is unacceptable.

I don't think academic physicists are a valid comparison. There are very few industry positions for theoretical physics, and most people do it because it is their passion and not for the promise of a good career. If we got rid of the bottleneck, medical physicists would be more similar to highly paid pharmacists or engineers without a hard bottleneck in hiring. Less qualified candidates would become certified junior medical physicists for cheap and be able to move up over time.</p>
>>>>><p>Are medical physicists overpaid that much? I’m not sure it’s more significantly than what American physicians are also overpaid. In general, average physicists make about half of wat an average radonc makes. This trend follows in at least a few major countries where I looked it up. 

That being said, I completely agree with moving the bottleneck to the graduate degree. Totally ridiculous scenario to be in.</p>
>>>>>><p>Great question! I assumed medical physicists would be overpaid because of the bottleneck, but this doesn't seem to be the case looking at the AAPM salary reports. In 2010, before CAMPEP programs and residencies were required for ABR certification, the average salary for a certified master's/PhD in medical physicists was $177k/$191k ($210k/$226k in 2020 dollars) and $204k/$215k in 2020, so salaries are almost keeping up with inflation. At a glance, it looks like the residency bottleneck has not lead to an increase in salaries.</p>
>>>><p>Real physics is low paying academic drudgery. :)

So in effect the shortage across the board for clinical physicists will continue? If the bottleneck persists, this is the only course. 
Then administrators will have to consider other alternatives to combat the lack of applicants with the same or greater census/workload, correct?</p>
><p>What type of positions are you talking about? Residency positions or general medical physics jobs available?</p>
>><p>General. Post bottleneck.</p>
