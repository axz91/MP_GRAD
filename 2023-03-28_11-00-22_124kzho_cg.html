<h1>[Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 03/28/2023</h1>
<p>This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
<li>"How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>

<p>Comment 1:</p>
<p>For various reasons, the user was unable to participate in the match this year, and the user is planning to graduate with a master's this May. The user is wondering what course of action the user should take in this type of situation.</p>
<p>Response 1:</p>
<p>Check the <a href="https://careers.aapm.org/">AAPM Career Services</a> board for off-cycle residency programs and programs not participating in the match.</p>
<p>Response 2:</p>
<p>Look for MP assistant positions.</p>

<p>Comment 2:</p>
<p>The user asks about the time limits on taking all the ABR parts.</p>
<p>Response 1:</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="https://www.theabr.org/medical-physics/initial-certification/certification-requirements/time-limits-and-board-eligibility">https://www.theabr.org/medical-physics/initial-certification/certification-requirements/time-limits-and-board-eligibility</a> for information on time limits for taking the ABR parts.</p>
<p>Response 2:</p>
<p>The user asks for clarification on "part 1 approval" and "part 2 approval".</p>
<p>Response 3:</p>
<p>The user explains that "part 1 approval" and "part 2 approval" refer to the application process for taking the ABR exam.</p>
<p>Response 4:</p>
<p>The user asks if it is true that one can apply to take part 1 during or after residency, and how many years one can wait to do residency.</p>
<p>Response 5:</p>
<p>The user is unsure about the answer and suggests referring to <a href="https://www.theabr.org/medical-physics/initial-certification/certification-requirements/time-limits-and-board-eligibility">https://www.theabr.org/medical-physics/initial-certification/certification-requirements/time-limits-and-board-eligibility</a> for relevant information.</p>
<p>Response 6:</p>
<p>The user humorously acknowledges that the previous response was already provided.</p>

<p>Comment 4:</p>
<p>The user asks how a particular lab/research activity or supervisor's field of research affects their residency program, specifically in relation to deep learning, MRI, PET-related research, projects, and studies during their Ph.D. The user also asks if they would be less eligible to apply for a therapy residency or vice versa.</p>
<p>Response 1:</p>
<p>The user states that they know some imaging PhDs who went into therapy residencies and that having a good understanding of imaging techniques can be beneficial. They suggest showing interest in therapy, both clinically and/or through research.</p>
<p>Response 2:</p>
<p>The user mentions that having a good understanding of imaging techniques can set the user apart from the competition, especially with advancements like MR-Linac and PET_Linacs.</p>
<p>Response 3:</p>
<p>The user shares their experience of attending a PhD program focused on imaging research and successfully pursuing a therapy residency. They emphasize that there are no limitations based on the user's research area.</p>
