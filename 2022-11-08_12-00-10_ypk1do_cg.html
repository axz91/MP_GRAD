<h1>[Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 11/08/2022</h1>
<p>This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
<li>"How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments:</h2>

<p><strong>Comment 1:</strong> Is a master degree specifically on MP the best path if one wants to get into the field? Or is it better to just study nuclear physics, as one possibly gets more breadth of physics in such a program?</p>
<p>I'm just feeling that it would be pretty bizarre to go and study nuclear physics and then apply for an MP position without ever having seen or studied a hospital LINAC up close, without having studied any of the concrete medical subjects which are important for MP, or without having done any internship (which is included in a program which I'm currently looking at, from KU Leuven in Belgium)</p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, would studying MP limit yourself in terms of physics job possibilities outside of MP?</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Comment 2:</strong> Through a long series of complicated circumstances, the user is currently getting a dual masters degree in Dosimetry (accredited) and Medical Physics (non-accredited) and is trying to figure out what some possible job opportunities/board certifications they might have in the future are. Their bachelors is in Physics with a math minor. They are asking if anyone has encountered someone who has done something similar or if there are any suggestions for internship concentrations/points of interest to look at.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comment 3:</strong> The user is comparing MS programs at Kentucky, LSU, and Vanderbilt based on clinical experience provided, financial support, and the cost of living. They mention that all three schools are good and held in high regard by clinical medical physicists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comment 4:</strong> The user is graduating in Spring 2024 with a Dual Degree in Physics & Biochemistry and has several questions about courses and general admissions requirements. They are concerned about the general admissions GPA requirement, how EMT Training looks for these programs, elective coursework for their Physics Degree, and the recommended amount of programming courses to take.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comment 5:</strong> Another user responds to Comment 4, providing advice on the admissions GPA requirement, the relevance of EMT Training, and recommendations for elective coursework and programming courses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comment 6:</strong> The user asks if anyone knows much about health physics as distinct from medical physics and if it is possible to enter that field with only a bachelor's degree.</p>
<p>Another user responds, providing a website for HP certification and sharing an example of someone who got an HP bachelor's degree and now works for a nuclear power plant. They mention that a bachelor's degree may be enough for certain positions, but for the title of "health physicist," networking skills or grad school may be required. They also explain the difference between medical physics and health physics, stating that medical physics is like a subfield of health physics with a focus on hospital/medical use.</p>
