<h1>[Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 11/01/2022</h1>
<p>This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
<li>"How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>

<p>Hi everyone, the user has a few concerns/questions regarding pursuing medical physics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user is 25 years old, has a BS in Exercise Science, and is pursuing a BS in Radiation Therapy.</li>
<li>The user has only taken introductory physics 1 and 2 (not calc based) and calculus 1, with no other physics courses.</li>
<li>The user is wondering about the best course of action since they believe a physics minor equivalent is required.</li>
<li>The user is considering chipping away at the prerequisites each semester.</li>
<li>Lastly, the user wants to know if they can still work as a radiation therapist while pursuing their master's degree (knowing that it's not an option for residency).</li>
</ul>
<p>Any advice is greatly appreciated!!!</p>
</li>

<p>The individual is an undergraduate student in America who is considering medical physics. They are wondering if it's worth doing a PhD instead of a master's if they plan to work as a clinical physicist.</p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p>It depends. PhDs have higher match rates, but MS isn't bad at around 60-70%. However, a PhD is not necessary to get into residency. Many MS graduates have successfully matched, and some program directors even prefer MS applicants due to their clinical focus. It's important to get into a strong, reputable program with good clinical experience. Ultimately, the decision should be based on individual circumstances and goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user asks about the difference between MS + Residency and DMP.</p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p>A DMP program does not require going through the process of finding a residency, but it comes with the downside of having to pay for the residency. On the other hand, an MS program only requires payment for the master's degree, and residency is paid. The degrees are not significantly different, and it's recommended to look into specific programs to see which one fits the user's needs.</p>
<p>Additional response:</p>
<p>It's worth noting that while residency slots are increasing, the number of DMP programs is not.</p>

<p>The user is currently taking Psychology as a pre-med course and is considering switching to Med Tech to possibly pursue a graduate degree in Medical Physics. They have limited options due to the lack of Physics or RadTech majors near their hometown.</p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p>It's important to provide more background information. However, for now, it's recommended to finish all courses in the current semester without dropping anything. If the user is in the US, the courses in the first semester are usually general and can be used to fulfill electives. It's also suggested to explore other careers that grant work visas or further studies, as being a technologist may not be the most desirable option for immigration purposes.</p>
<p>Additional response:</p>
<p>For furthering education and being admitted to graduate school in Canada or the US, a solid bachelor's degree is preferred over online certificates. It's advisable to consult with an academic counselor and take it step by step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user is unsure if universities will consider online certificates from prestigious institutions like Harvard or Stanford.</p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p>For graduate admissions, universities typically prioritize high GPA, good Letters of Recommendation, and relevant research/work experience. While online certificates may have value in certain careers, a solid bachelor's degree is generally more important for graduate school admissions.</p>
