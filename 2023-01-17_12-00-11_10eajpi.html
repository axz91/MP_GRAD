<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 01/17/2023</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

<p><b>Are residency interviews asking for “an 8 minute presentation on the topic of your choosing” really just code for telling you to talk about your research??</b></p>
><p>No.   They want to see you be able to communicate and demonstrate some competence, understanding and interest in the field.  It could show your understanding of the clinic or research, whether yours or not.  I saw candidates who presented their research, especially PhDs but some masters students, too.  I saw a PhD certificate student present a research paper he had read.  I talked about some clinical development projects and my masters thesis to show some breadth.  My thesis wasn’t very deep or complex but I could tie it to clinical applications.   Clinically focused was what I wanted to present myself as, from personal statement to interview to presentation.    And all of the programs I applied to were fundamentally clinical training positions, even if they had lots of opportunity for research (so no 3-year research+clinic programs).

So. I’d tailor your choice of topic to what you’ve done, what you’d like to do, what you think you could talk about clearly and what that program is looking for.</p>
><p>Pretty much. That's usually the easiest thing for prospective candidates to talk about anyway</p>
>><p>Ok cool, thanks. I was like 95% sure but appreciate you removing any doubt!</p>
