<h1>[Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 02/07/2023</h1>
<p>This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
<li>"How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments:</h2>

<p>Hey everyone! The user just wanted to ask what is the best path to becoming a dosimetrist? The user is currently a radiation therapist and has been looking into getting a masters in dosimetry. The user wants to know how hard it is to get into dosimetry programs and what would be the best way to stand out on the application. The user has been interested for a few years and would love to know what school is recommended. Any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Is there universities in the US that offer BS in medical physics? If so, does it help to prepare for graduate medical physics programs?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The response states that they don't know if there are universities offering a BS in medical physics, but it might be problematic. The response explains that the undergrad physics courses that are expected are more like classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, E & M, etc. The response mentions that back when ABR was checking undergrad courses, they specifically excluded anything that sounded medical, even optics and electronics.</p>

<p>Hello everyone, has anyone heard anything from Penn regarding interviews for their graduate program? The user applied, but has yet to hear anything and their interview dates are scheduled for next week. Thanks!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The response states that a friend who is still at Penn mentioned that they are still sending invites but will be done soon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The user thanks the responder for the reply.</p>

<li>
<p>The user mentions that the residency they went into adhered to University policies with which it was associated. They would not hire smokers, including tobacco and cigarettes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It might be a bit early, but the user graduates in December. The user asks if anyone knows of any CAMPEP residencies that have a January start date.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The response suggests that the nonmatch residencies might have January start dates.</p>

<p>Hey all, the user has a question regarding drug screening before residency. The user explains that they have been smoking cigarettes and weed on and off, but now they have ordered a self-testing kit for THC and started complete abstinence. The user asks if anyone has any knowledge about drug screening before residency and any information would be tremendously helpful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first response states that their facility does require a drug test for incoming residents, including medical physicists. The responder mentions that they do not know if the drug test specifically looks for cigarette-related substances and/or THC. The responder recalls that THC can be problematic because of how long it can persist in the body and show up in urine.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The second response confirms that they had to get a drug test before starting their residency, along with other healthcare industry specific tests. The responder mentions that cigarettes are not illegal in the United States, so they won't test for it or care if the user smokes cigarettes. The responder also suggests that once the user gets into residency and sees how most lung cancer patients smell like cigarette smoke, they may change their mind on that habit. The user thanks the responder for sharing the information and wishes them luck on the Match.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The third response advises the user to note that any subsequent jobs they get after residency will also require the same process, so they should adjust marijuana/THC consumption accordingly. The user thanks the responder for the heads up and mentions that they will definitely be mindful of it.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The third response states that it's pretty standard for the drug screen to happen during the onboard process, which would be around April-June if the user matches. The responder believes that should be enough time for the user's system to clear the substances. The user thanks the responder for the input and asks if the screening test includes testing for tobacco/nicotine consumption as well.</p>
