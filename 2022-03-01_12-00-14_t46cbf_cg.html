<h1>[Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 03/01/2022</h1>
<p>This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
<li>"How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<h3>Comment 1:</h3>
<p>The user will be starting their grad school (MS) in the Fall. They have taken a program with lots of clinical experience in NY. Being an International Student, the first thing that came to their mind is to think of residency from now. They are already doing a competitive course in Data Science from a Top School. They have this summer and one more next year. They are seeking advice on what kind of opportunities they should look out for in the next few years and what others would have done if they were starting out now.</p>
<h4>Response 1:</h4>
<p>Another user suggests that the user should only pursue a masters in physics if they don't go into debt to get that extra masters. They consider it a poor financial decision.</p>
<p>Response to Response 1:</p>
<p>The user asks how many programs the commenter applied to.</p>
<h4>Response 2:</h4>
<p>The commenter clarifies that they meant not to go into debt for a pure physics masters just to have a better chance at a completely different masters. They consider it a poor financial decision.</p>
<p>Response to Response 2:</p>
<p>The user asks about low tier masters programs and mentions that they are waiting to hear back from a few currently.</p>
<p>Response to Response to Response 2:</p>
<p>The commenter mentions that they applied to Hofstra and hopes for a positive outcome.</p>
<h3>Comment 2:</h3>
<p>The user received offers for MS programs in medical physics and is trying to decide between Oregon Health & Science University, University of Oklahoma, and Purdue. They are seeking opinions on these universities, including their strengths, weaknesses, and general likability.</p>
<h4>Response 1:</h4>
<p>Another user thanks the commenter and mentions that they will keep the information in mind as they plan to visit one of the universities soon.</p>
<p>Response to Response 1:</p>
<p>The commenter expresses gratitude for the help received.</p>
<h3>Comment 3:</h3>
<p>The user is wondering if it would be a bad idea to pursue a masters in physics and then apply to medical physics masters and PhD programs afterwards. They mention their GPA (3.3) and lack of success in their current applications. They are seeking advice.</p>
<h4>Response 1:</h4>
<p>Another user advises against pursuing an extra masters if it would result in going into debt. They consider it a poor financial decision.</p>
<h3>Comment 4:</h3>
<p>The user has received an interview invitation for the masters program at Brown University. They are seeking information on what to expect in the interview process.</p>
<h4>Response 1:</h4>
<p>Another user shares their experience of interviewing for PhD programs and mentions the most common questions they were asked. They also provide tips for preparation.</p>
<p>Response to Response 1:</p>
<p>The commenter thanks the user for the information and asks about the competitiveness of getting into a school.</p>
<p>Response to Response to Response 1:</p>
<p>The user clarifies that they were referring to the competitiveness of residency programs, not grad school.</p>
<p>Response to Response to Response to Response 1:</p>
<p>The commenter admits that they don't know much about grad school competitiveness, but mentions that certain big names are considered competitive.</p>
<h3>Comment 5:</h3>
<p>The user is deciding between offers for their Medical Physics PhD and is concerned about the stigma around doing their graduate degree at the same university where they did their undergraduate degree. They seek advice on whether this should influence their decision.</p>
<h4>Response 1:</h4>
<p>Another user advises the user not to be too concerned about the stigma and suggests that if they like the program and find the research interesting, they should go for it.</p>
<h3>Comment 6:</h3>
<p>The user is currently an undergraduate student exploring various careers. They ask about the role of a medical physicist, job availability, majors that prepare for this career, and alternative careers of interest.</p>
<h4>Response 1:</h4>
<p>Another user provides a link to a resource that explains what a medical physicist does. They also mention that job availability may vary and suggest majors such as Physics, Astrophysics, Biomedical Engineering, and Nuclear Engineering as good preparation. They mention that they would have focused on being an MRI scientist if not on the medical physics path.</p>
<p>Response to Response 1:</p>
<p>The user thanks the commenter and asks about the different types of residencies available.</p>
<p>Response to Response to Response 1:</p>
<p>The commenter explains that there are two residency tracks in medical physics: diagnostic and therapy. They provide an overview of the work involved in each track and mention that residencies can be pursued in academic centers or consulting companies.</p>
<p>Response to Response to Response to Response 1:</p>
<p>The user asks about the competitiveness of getting into a school.</p>
<p>Response to Response to Response to Response to Response 1:</p>
<p>The commenter admits that they don't know much about grad school competitiveness, but mention that residency programs are highly competitive.</p>
<p>Response to Response to Response to Response to Response to Response 1:</p>
<p>The user asks the commenter about their reasons for choosing medical physics.</p>
