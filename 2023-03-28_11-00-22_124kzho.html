<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 03/28/2023</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

<p><b>For various reasons, I was unable to participate in the match this year, and I am planning to graduate with a master's this May.   
I was wondering what course of action I should take in this type of situation.</b></p>
><p>Check the [AAPM Career Services](https://careers.aapm.org/) board for off-cycle residency programs and programs not participating in the match.

Look for MP assistant positions</p>
<p><b>What are the time limits on taking all the ABR parts</b></p>

>><p>Follow up: what is "part 1 approval" and "part 2 approval"?</p>
>>><p>You need to apply to take part 1 or part 2. The ABR either approves or rejects your application to take the exam. That’s what this is referring to, I think.</p>
>>>><p>I'm reading that I can apply to part 1 during or after residency, is this true? How many years can I wait to do residency?</p>
>>>>><p>No idea. I'm not ABR-certified. This looks relevant: [https://www.theabr.org/medical-physics/initial-certification/certification-requirements/time-limits-and-board-eligibility](https://www.theabr.org/medical-physics/initial-certification/certification-requirements/time-limits-and-board-eligibility)</p>
>>>>>><p>lmao that's the page I linked to.</p>
>>>>>>><p>I only realized after posting, then figured I’d leave it for *emphasis*.</p>
<p><b>I saw a post regarding the med phys discord. Does that still exist?</b></p>
><p>Yeah but it’s kinda dead tbh

<p><b>How does a particular lab/research activity or supervisor's field of research affect your residency program? For example, if I mainly work on deep learning, MRI, or PET-related research, projects, and studies during my Ph.D., also taking to account if the dissertation is limited to the imaging area, am I less eligible to apply for a therapy residency or vice versa?</b></p>
><p>I know some imaging PhDs who went into therapy residencies.  Though you're depth in imaging knowledge will be more than you need for therapy, it will help.  You should show some good interest in therapy, clinical and/or research - depending on the resident you're looking at.  You don't need to be at the PhD level of work to show therapy interest - remember most of us are just masters students who did a bit of clinical shadowing, QA, a bit of masters level research, etc.</p>
><p>You should be fine, specially now with MR-Linac and even PET\_Linacs some day, having a good understanding of those imaging techniques will set you apart from competition</p>
><p>During my graduate program we had a talk from one of the people involved in hiring therapy residents and he said he prefers residents who did imaging in grad school because he likes having more well rounded residents.</p>
><p>I did imaging research at a PhD program known for its imaging, and ended up with my goal therapy residency. You are not limited in the slightest.</p>
