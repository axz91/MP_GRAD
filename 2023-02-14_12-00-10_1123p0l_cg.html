<p>This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>

<h3>Comment 1:</h3>
<p>Transition from Dosimetrist to Physicist</p>
<p>Hello! The user has been a dosimetrist for close to 7 years now and their current employer would like them to consider the idea of becoming a junior physicist.</p>
<p>The user has always thought they would entertain the idea to become a medical physicist one day, but never have pursued the thought. They realize there is a much larger responsibility/expectation of becoming a physicist compared to taking on a junior physicist role.</p>
<p>The user really enjoys their job as a dosimetrist, but they also feel like they havenâ€™t hit their own professional ceiling.</p>
<p>The user is seeking advice or past experiences from others who have made a similar jump from dosimetrist to physicist.</p>
<p>Thank you for all responses!</p>
