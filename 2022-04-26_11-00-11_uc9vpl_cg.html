<h2>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 04/26/2022</h2>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>

<h3>Examples:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
  <li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
  <li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
  <li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
  <li>"How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>

    <p>Currently the user is in Nepal and wants to pursue an MS in Medical Physics in an Australian university. The user asks if they should apply and if they can get residency after completing the course. They also inquire about the difficulty of finding a job after obtaining an MS.</p>
    <p>Response 1: As a medical physicist, there may be limitations on international work opportunities due to the regulations and certifications required in different countries. For example, in the US, ABR certification is necessary for clinical medical physicists, which requires CAMPEP certification. This can make it challenging for international individuals to pursue a career in medical physics outside of their country of education.</p>

    <p>A user expresses uncertainty about the possibility of getting free CT scans for life as a medical physicist.</p>
    <p>Response 1: There have been no reports of medical physicists receiving free CT scans for life. However, if the user has an anxiety disorder, it is recommended to seek help from a doctor or therapist.</p>

    <p>A user who is about to start their medical physics Ph.D. in the fall asks for opinions on choosing tracks. They mention their interest in both therapy and molecular imaging/nuclear medicine projects and inquire if this could cause issues in the future.</p>
    <p>Response 1: Congratulations on starting your medical physics Ph.D.! It is not necessary to work on your dissertation topic as a primary focus in your post-residency employment. Choose a project that is interesting to you and has good support, such as a supportive principal investigator and funding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A user has been accepted to multiple CAMPEP MS medical physics programs and is seeking advice on making a decision.</p>
    <p>Response 1: Consider aligning your choice with your career goals. If your goal is clinical work, prioritize programs with good board preparation and success rates, as well as a high residency match rate. If you are leaning towards industry or pursuing a Ph.D., consider the faculty connections and research history of the programs. It may be helpful to reach out for more information.</p>
    <p>Response 2: Minimize costs and maximize clinical opportunities when making your decision. Choose a program that allows you to achieve these goals and where you can envision yourself living for the duration of the program.</p>

    <p>A user asks for insights into the Creighton Medical Physics MS program, including experiences and success in securing a residency.</p>

    <p>A user expresses interest in pursuing an MS in medical physics and becoming a physicist. They have a physics degree from five years ago with average grades but have been working as a service engineer in the field for the past three years. They wonder if this experience will help them get accepted into an MS program.</p>
    <p>Response 1: Having hands-on experience working with clinical equipment is definitely a plus. While grades are part of the application, they are not the sole determining factor. Focus on obtaining strong letters of recommendation and achieving a decent GRE score if required. It is also important to consider programs with a high residency match percentage if your goal is to become a clinical physicist.</p>
    <p>Response 2: Getting into a good CAMPEP university with a low GPA is possible. Don't worry too much about straight A's. Instead, focus on showcasing your experience and skills through your application.</p>
