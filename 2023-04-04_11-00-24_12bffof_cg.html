Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 04/04/2023

Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples:

- "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
- "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
- "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
- "Masters vs. PhD"
- "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"

Comment 1:
The user, who is one of the applicants accepted to Purdue's MS degree program in medical physics for the fall, is seeking a general overview of what it is like to attend Purdue before making a decision. They are torn between Purdue and UPenn, as Purdue offers a scholarship that covers tuition and fees, along with clinical exposure and research opportunities. However, they are concerned about Purdue's match rates for residency. On the other hand, UPenn requires taking a loan for tuition and living expenses but has higher match rates, more clinical exposure, and unique experiences. The user is worried about being in debt for a significant portion of their life if they choose UPenn. They are seeking information about Purdue's program and any other aspects they should consider.

Response 1:
A recommendation is given to choose UPenn based on positive feedback from others and higher match rates. The user suggests that residency is a crucial point in the field and maximizing the chances of getting one is important. They mention that UPenn's program is great and emphasize the long-term benefits of investing in education for a clinical career.

Comment 2:
The user asks about the experience of individuals who applied for residency as MS MP graduates with little or no experience, did not match, and then pursued a PhD or gained relevant clinical experience before reapplying. They are interested in knowing how the residency interviews went the second time around and if they received more interview opportunities.

Response 2:
A user shares their experience of using the review section in "wepassed" for part 1 of the exam but finding some questions to be outdated. They recommend using Huda's radiological physics book for imaging and Khan's Lectures for therapy. They also suggest referring to a handbook of anatomy/physiology and express gratitude for the information.

Response 3:
Another user confirms that they have Huda's book and expresses their intention to find it based on the recommendation.

Comment 3:
The user seeks information about the day-to-day work life of an Imaging Physicist after residency. They are deciding whether to accept an imaging residency offer for January 2024 or wait for a therapy residency in July 2024, which they have more interest in. They inquire about the level of mathematical physics involved in therapy compared to imaging and if that should be a basis for their decision. They also ask if there is anything that sets Diagnostic apart from Therapy in terms of job prospects.

Response 4:
A user shares their perspective on the advantages of being an Imaging Physicist, mentioning the variety of machines and procedures they deal with, which keeps things fresh. They also mention that the pay is better for therapy and there are more job opportunities. They advise the user to choose based on their happiness and long-term satisfaction.

Response 5:
Another user reiterates the advantages of being an Imaging Physicist, emphasizing the wider range of experiences and the opportunity to work with different machines. They also mention the better pay and more job availability in therapy. They suggest choosing the field that aligns with personal happiness.

Comment 4:
The user expresses gratitude for the valuable insight provided by the previous responses.

Response 6:
A user shares their biased opinion that therapy is not simpler than imaging and finds it more interesting. They emphasize that there is no correct answer regarding which field is better and it ultimately depends on individual preferences.

Comment 5:
A user asks about the courses required to be considered a Physics minor and seeks advice on what courses to take to strengthen their application for grad school in medical physics.

Response 7:
A user suggests contacting the programs of interest to inquire about their specific prerequisites for a Physics minor. They mention that some programs have more specific recommendations/requirements listed on their websites.

Response 8:
A first-year resident shares their experience as a physics major and suggests taking intermediate/advanced courses in E&M, quantum physics, and modern physics. They also recommend a hands-on lab course and mention the importance of calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations. They suggest checking with the university and graduate programs for specific requirements.

Comment 6:
The user expresses gratitude for the detailed information provided and mentions their intention to look into radiation safety at hospitals.

Comment 7:
The user asks for advice on applying to grad school and requests information about GPA and experience when applying to medical physics programs to assess their chances of acceptance.

Response 9:
A user shares their experience of applying to CAMPEP masters programs with a 2.9 GPA in physics and no prior medical physics experience. They mention that strong letters of recommendation played a significant role in their acceptance. They also suggest shadowing a clinical medical physicist if possible.

Response 10:
Another user shares their experience of applying to grad schools with a 3.84 GPA in physics and 2 years of MRI research experience. They advise checking the application window for the desired programs and recommend starting the application process in December-February before the intended fall semester.

Comment 8:
The user asks for advice on transitioning into health physics in the medical field and expresses concerns about a potential pay decrease. They also inquire about scholarships related to the field.

Response 11:
A user clarifies the difference between health physics and medical physics and suggests exploring radiation safety positions at hospitals for a transition into the medical field. They provide information about the training requirements for medical physics and mention the possibility of pursuing a medical physics certificate program or a master's degree followed by a residency. They also mention the prerequisites for CAMPEP programs and suggest checking with universities and graduate programs for specific requirements.

Comment 9:
The user expresses gratitude for the provided information and mentions their intention to explore radiation safety positions at hospitals.

Comment 10:
The user asks when to start applying for PhD programs in medical physics, mainly for scholarships. They mention completing their first year and working on a thesis project.

Response 12:
A user explains that most PhD programs waive tuition and provide a stipend, so scholarships may not be necessary for tuition purposes. They mention that the AAPM website offers fellowships and grants for current grad students but are unsure about scholarships for prospective students. They suggest checking the deadlines, which are typically in December-February before the intended fall semester.

Comment 11:
The user asks for recommendations on the best free resources for ABR p1.

Response 13:
A user suggests "Oncology medical physics" as a resource for ABR p1.
