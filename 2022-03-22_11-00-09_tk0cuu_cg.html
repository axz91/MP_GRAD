<h1>[Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 03/22/2022</h1>
<p>This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
<li>"How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments:</h2>

<p>Did anyone interview or apply to UNLV DMP program?</p>
<p>Response 1: I applied. Haven’t heard anything on the interview front, and all my other interviews happened 2+ weeks ago.</p>
<p>Response 2: I think it’s just a list of common example questions that get flooded here regularly. Since DMP is less common, there aren’t as many questions about it. The examples listed don’t encompass all topics that should be discussed in these weekly threads though. I’ve seen plenty of discussion of DMPs here recently.</p>

<p>I’m trying to decide between undergrad UC Berkeley NE program and UT Austin Physics program. Anyone who went to those schools have suggestions/thoughts?</p>
<p>Response 1: I didn’t go to either, but the most important things to getting into our field is knowing it exists, having an interest in it and getting some experience. Both should give you great coverage of the fundamental physics, so that’s not a concern.</p>
<p>Response 2: If you could talk with medical physicists at / around those schools, I bet you could find summer research or shadowing opportunities. UT Austin has a medical physics program and that would be a place to start asking. Shadowing / research would both be quite helpful in determining if this is the right field for you, and displaying your interest when applying to grad schools. Also, don’t disregard your own happiness, social development and personal well-being when picking a school. Being likable, collaborative and well socially adjusted goes a lot further in our field than you might think.</p>

<p>Hello! I recently got accepted into Umiami's med physics program and I was wondering if anyone has had any thoughts about it. Thanks!</p>
<p>Response 1: Pretty campus and funded. That's really all I know. Cost of living didn't seem terrible but wasn't cheap either (but of course I live in Seattle so not bad isn't saying much).</p>
<p>Response 2: Mostly commenting because I too want to know more about their program.</p>

<p>Does anyone have information on a course-based masters program in Canada? I know Western has a new, one year MSc in Clinical Medical Biophysics, but I am concerned about its future outlook since it is so new (only 2 students so far!). Are there any other masters in Canada that don't require a thesis? Would you even recommend going this route?</p>
<p>Response 1: If you want to work in Canada you need a PhD from a CAMPEP accredited program. If you only want to do a masters you will have to look for residencies/jobs in the US. Ryerson, Dalhousie, Calgary, McGill, Western, UVic have the course based programs I believe, though I think these are intended for those who have already completed a MSc or PhD in a related field.</p>
