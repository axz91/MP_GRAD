<h1>[Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 03/21/2023</h1>
<p>This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.</p>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"</li>
<li>"I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."</li>
<li>"Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"</li>
<li>"Masters vs. PhD"</li>
<li>"How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments:</h2>

<p>Hi all</p>
<p>The user is a nuclear medicine tech currently. The user has been looking into career change possibilities due to the lack of progression/advancement in the field. The user is considering medical physics and has taken basic calculus and physics courses in college. The user is unsure if MS programs value experience in nuclear medicine and is interested in the radiation therapy side of medical physics. The user is seeking insight and tips.</p>
<p><em>Response 1:</em> The commenter doubts that experience in nuclear medicine will hurt the user's application for MS programs. The commenter suggests that the user may need a BS degree if they don't already have one. The commenter advises the user to research graduate programs, particularly those accredited by CAMPEP if they are in the US or Canada. The commenter recommends learning about the programs and contacting faculty members conducting research that aligns with the user's interests.</p>

<p>The minimum requirement for a Masters program is a minor equivalent of physics. Most applicants are physics undergrads, but individuals from nuclear and biomedical engineering programs are also accepted as long as they have the equivalent of a physics minor. The commenter, a Physics PhD student, believes that the user is overqualified for a Masters program but acknowledges that it is still a valid option. The commenter mentions that certificate programs require a PhD in physics. Regarding residency, the commenter suggests looking at programs on the CAMPEP website and filtering based on residency match rates. The commenter highlights that some top-tier programs have high match rates. The commenter also mentions that the certificate route is a valid option and shares an example of a graduate student who pursued the certificate program alongside their Physics PhD. The commenter advises the user to consider the financial aspect when making a decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user asks if there are any MS students from Creighton or graduates from the school and inquires about their experience in the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user is interested in knowing the difference between a Masters and a PhD, particularly in terms of residency placement rates, salary, and research ability. The user specifies that they are mostly interested in clinical work.</p>
<p><em>Response 1:</em> The commenter states that the salary difference between a Masters and a PhD is minimal, unless comparing leadership positions. The commenter mentions that residency placement rates are better for PhD candidates but emphasizes that MS programs are not awful, as they have an MS themselves. The commenter explains that some clinics prefer MS applicants due to their clinical experience. The commenter also notes that MS students can actively participate in research and mentions that research opportunities depend on the clinic's availability. The commenter advises the user to find an MS program with a strong clinical component if their focus is on clinical work. The commenter suggests evaluating match rates published by CAMPEP and mentions the financial aspect as another factor to consider.</p>
<p><em>Response 2:</em> Another commenter agrees with the comparison between Masters and PhD programs. They mention that Masters programs can be expensive, while PhD programs may allow students to graduate debt-free by waiving tuition and providing a stipend. The commenter suggests considering PhD programs that offer an en route Masters degree for those who may want to pursue a PhD later in life. This allows the user to delay the decision until they are more familiar with the field.</p>
<p><em>Response 3:</em> Another commenter adds that Masters students can work as Graduate Research Assistants (GRAs) or Teaching Assistants (TAs) while pursuing their Masters. They mention that this can significantly reduce the cost of tuition and provide a salary position. The commenter suggests that Masters students interested in the medical imaging field or therapy field should actively search for such opportunities.</p>
<p><em>Response 4:</em> Another commenter, who originally obtained an expensive "ivy league" Masters and is interested in pursuing a PhD post-residency, agrees with the previous comments. They mention that a PhD is not a prerequisite for administrative positions and share their experience working with a clinical director who has an MS-level degree. However, they acknowledge that a PhD can be a significant help in achieving administrative goals.</p>
