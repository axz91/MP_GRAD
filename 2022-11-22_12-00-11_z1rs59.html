<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 11/22/2022</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

<p><b>Hello med physics reddit, this is my first time posting I’m currently a software developer but considering career changing. I have a BS in biomedical physics and want to know how long it would take to become a working physicist from now? Considering a MS not phD. Thanks!</b></p>
><p>If you just want a MS you can get it done in 2 years. With the MS you can work as MPA and industry, but you need to go to the 2-3 yrs residency and pass the board exams to be a certified medical physicist</p>
>><p>MPA is medical physicist assistant? You can’t be a clinical MP with a MS degree?

Oh sorry just read you can after being certified</p>
<p><b>Hi physicists! Do you think MPA is more advantageous when it comes to application for residency? (I work in Asia)

I recently got an offer for the post of oncology technician. It is a new post in their department, so I believe the duties are like that of MPA.

I am currently working as a FSE. If I’m switching to the technician post, I would be taking a salary cut (like a 10% drop). It is really puzzling and I cannot make a decision.

Appreciate if you could give me some insights! Thank you!</b></p>
<p><b>**Medical Physicists of reddit, do you have any suggestions for good books that can give me a general overview of the Medical Physics field?** 

I already have Khan (for a general book), Paganetti (for proton therapy) and "Review of Radiation Oncology Physics: A Handbook for Teachers and Students" by Podgorsak. If there is any book that focused on how the different types of radiation delivery systems work, it would be great: (IMRT, VMAT, proton therapy,...); Pencil Beam Scanning vs Passive scattering ....

I started a PhD in Medical Physics one year ago and I don't have any problems with the theoretical (physics) part of the work, as I have a MsC. in Physics Engineering. However, everything that is related to the radiation delivery systems is pretty much unknown to me.

&#x200B;

Thank you for your suggestions.    :)</b></p>
><p>Those sound like good texts to start with, just wondering do you have a radiation therapy class that goes over this too? The instructor ought to know some manuscripts, particularly if there are newer technologies that you need/want to learn about.</p>
>><p>Thank you for your reply! To answer your question, I don't. That's essentially my problem. Since in my university the Medical Physics field it's still being implemented, the courses that I'm able to attend are almost entirely unrelated to Medical Physics. These books were recommended to me by colleagues from the research center were I'm doing my PhD.

I just asked to see if the people from reddit had any other recomendations, specially because I find the Podgorsak to be not that great...</p>
<p><b>I am a first year MS student, when do you normally take the ABR/when did you start studying?</b></p>
><p>Most seem to spend 2-3 months studying. The timeline is somewhat set by the ABR and when they decide to hold the exams; it has been shuffled around a bit (stupidly) in the last 2 years or so.</p>
>><p>I've seen January, which would make sense (between 3rd and 4th semester and before residency interviews). Hopefully they stay consistent with that.

Also, any idea of when parts 2 and 3 are taken relative to the residency timeline?</p>
>>><p>It's not going to be January anymore, I think that 2023 is the last January administration, should go back to August in the future ([https://www.theabr.org/medical-physics/calendar](https://www.theabr.org/medical-physics/calendar)) . Like it said it was a stupid change to begin with.</p>
>>>><p>Ah I see! Thank you</p>

><p>Not US, but I known Canadians physicists (so also CAMPEP accredited) that have moved from there to Australia. So it's certainly possible, but not sure on the exact process. 

Since there are so many different accreditation organizations I think it would be very country dependent whether it was possible, but I know being CAMPEP accredited will help a lot, as well as having more experience in the field previously.

My best advice would be to reach out to the professional bodies in the countries you're interested in to discuss what the process would be to being accredited wit in that country. And if it's possible, look for work in those countries.</p>
<p><b>Semi-reposting, since I had no replies in last week's thread...

I am applying to grad schools for medical physics, 3 of them, all in the US (I'm in the US). One of my recommenders is a professor at the university where I got my undergrad physics degree this spring and we were on quite good terms. He has asked me to template my own letter of recommendation for him to add to and edit. I imagine he is quite busy because he runs a significant chunk of the physics research programs there, as well as teaching ALL of the junior and senior undergrad labs plus most if not all the grad-level ones, AND English is not his first language (he tends to struggle with grammar a bit despite being absolutely brilliant, and he's always struck me as being a bit embarrassed/frustrated that it's a barrier for him, but is still a fantastic and passionate teacher. He also knows my other bachelors degree is in communication).  
  
What are skills or points to touch on that would be good to include in my template? I have not been able to do research yet but my academic performance was very good (3.87 GPA) and my labs and reports were considered excellent. Obviously I'm not going to tell them I have skills I don't have (for instance, my in-person presentations are... a bit lackluster, due to anxiety, so I wouldn't put that as one of my skills), but I don't really even know from what angle to approach this.</b></p>
><p>When I have to write these for my letter writers, I typically break it up into three sections.  The first section I focus on who is recommending me ("I am so and so from this university with these qualifications and I'm teaching these courses/doing this research")(I take this information primarily from the "about the faculty" that most places have if I don't otherwise know it).  The second section I follow up with information about the program/workplace you are at ("XYZ University's program is accredited by this or that certifying body with a well-known track record for...")(Again, taken from the "program's about" page).   
The last section is where I will talk about myself and the relationship with my letter writer.  For a professor, I would focus on my academic performance in the class and mention any projects you may have worked on that could show soft skills (writing ability, interpersonal skills).  I don't think it's out of the question at this point to mention any organizations or extracurricular's you may be involved in as well ("prep\_the\_ion\_cannon is a well-rounded student who enjoys prepping ion cannons and hiking in their free time"). 

&#x200B;

I followed this format at several points in my career (including undergrad) and generally most letter writers have only made minor corrections or added more to the last section.</p>
><p>Strong work ethic and leadership stuff maybe? If these are phd programs or research heavy MS programs then maybe he can comment on the work you’ve done with that?</p>
<p><b>What is the role of a  medical physics demonstrator at a radiotherapy clinic?if somebody can explain.</b></p>
