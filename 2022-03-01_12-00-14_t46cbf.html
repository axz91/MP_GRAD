<h3>Post Title: [Training Tuesday] - Weekly thread for questions about grad school, residency, and general career topics 03/01/2022</h3>
<p>Post Content: This is the place to ask questions about graduate school, training programs, or general basic career topics. If you are just learning about the field and want to know if it is something you should explore, this thread is probably the correct place for those first few questions on your mind.

Examples: 

* "I majored in Surf Science and Technology in undergrad, is Medical Physics right for me?"
* "I can't decide between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics..."
* "Do Medical Physicists get free CT scans for life?"
* "Masters vs. PhD"
* "How do I prepare for Residency interviews?"</p>

<p><b>I will be starting my grad school (MS) this Fall. I have taken a program with lots of clinical experience in NY. Being an International Student, first thing that came to my mind is to think of residency from now. Already doing a very (we have different definition of competitive, nvm) competitive course in Data Science from a Top School. I have this summer in-front of me which I can use and one more next year. What kinda opportunities I should look out for next few years? What you would have done if you were starting out now?

*Edit 1 - Therapy Medical Physics</b></p>
<p><b>Hello, I am currently an undergrad and I’ve received a few offers for MS programs in medical physics. I’ve been trying to decide which, and have been struggling a bit. I know the things that *I* think I like about these programs, but I don’t really have access to the opinions of people who work in this field. Would y’all mind sharing your perceptions/opinions of these universities? As in, what you think their strengths are, what they’re bad at, how much you like them in general, etc.

1. Oregon Health & Science University
2. University of Oklahoma
3. Purdue

Thank you so much!! I’m so lost right now and any help is very much appreciated.</b></p>

<p><b>I'm wondering if it would be a bad idea to pursue a masters in physics and then afterwards apply to medical physics masters and phd programs afterwards? My GPA isnt the best (3.3) and while I do have some research experience I have currently been denied from every program I've applied to. If anyone has any advice I would gladly take it!</b></p>
><p>Only if you don't go into debt to get that extra masters. To me, that'd be a poor financial decision.

How many programs did you apply to?</p>
>><p>[deleted]</p>
>>><p>I meant dont go into debt for a pure physics masters just to have a better chance at a completely different masters. Poor financial decision to me</p>
>>>><p>[deleted]</p>
>>>>><p>What are the low tier masters programs? I’m waiting to hear back from a few currently.</p>

>>>>>>><p>I did apply to Hofstra so let’s hope lmao</p>
<p><b>Hello, I just received an email informing me that I have been selected for an interview for the masters program at Brown University. This will be my first graduate school interview and I would really appreciate some information on what I should expect in this process.</b></p>
><p>I’ve interviewed for a few PhD programs this year with success so far. The most common thing I was prompted to do was describe my research at a high level. A couple people tried grilling me a little, but it wasn’t too bad considering I studied my research beforehand. 

Otherwise, the five most common questions I got were (in order): (1) tell me about yourself (2) what are your goals beyond graduate school? (3) why do you feel that our institution/my lab is an appropriate fit for your needs? (4) why medical physics? (5) what do you seek in a graduate program/what resources do you need to succeed?

Prepare for those and perhaps for some behavioral questions (e.g., weaknesses, strengths, teamwork, challenges). One program of mine was a panel interview and had some left-field questions (i.e., (1) what makes you more competitive than other applicants? (2) what makes you a real person?) Some schools (like Duke, I believe) might do MMIs. Also be sure to prepare a bunch of questions for the interviewer! If your interviewer is a PI, you can look at their most recent papers or look up their current grants to generate some questions. Good luck! Feel free to reach out if you have questions or just want to chat about it</p>
><p>The below was my experience years ago and also not at Brown:

Tell us about yourself. What are your hobbies. Why physics. Why medical physics. Why <insert grad program here>. It's crucial to remember you are interviewing them too!</p>
<p><b>I'm currently deciding between a couple offers for where I would like to do my Medical Physics PhD and I am pretty sure I know which program is my top choice. The only thing I am hesitant on is that my top choice is the same university that I am attending for undergrad as I have heard in the past there is a stigma around people who do their graduate degree at the same place they did their undergraduate degree. Is this something I should be worried about for my Medical Physics PhD or is it something that should not influence my decision?</b></p>
><p>[deleted]</p>
>><p>Echo this if anyone’s up to talk. I’m in a similar boat and have no idea how to choose</p>
>>><p>[deleted]</p>
>>>><p>I faced the how-to-choose situation earlier this cycle and have made my decision, so feel free to add me if you'd like to have a chat</p>
><p>I wouldn't be too concerned about it.  If you like the program and find the research they're doing interesting, go for it.</p>
<p><b>Hello! I am currently in undergrad and trying to explore as many careers as possible. What does a medical Physicist do? Is it hard to find a job? What are some good majors that prepare you for this career? Finally, If not a medical physicist, what career would you have interest in? Thanks!</b></p>
><p>For what does a medical physics do? - [https://medicalphysics.med.wayne.edu/faq-students](https://medicalphysics.med.wayne.edu/faq-students) this is a link from the resources tab on the right (there's a good guide there as well).

Hard to find a job: I don't know, still a grad student trying to get a residency position, but it seems like the job market is vast (for certified medical physicists), other user can give better input.

Majors that are good: Physics, Astrophysics, biomedical engineering, nuclear engineering, I think those are good ones to prepare.

I would probably be focusing on being an MRI scientist if I wasn't on the medphys path.</p>
>><p>Thanks for the reply! What kind of residencies are there?</p>
>>><p>So you can divide MedPhys in two buckets: diagnostic and therapy. Diagnostic you work with imaging equipment (CT,MRI,ultrasound) and nuclear medicine, so working with equipment that images the patient to help doctors achieve an diagnosis. In therapy you work with linear accelerators (linacs), brachytherapy, etc... stuff relating to the use of radiation to treat tumors.

So there are 2 residencies tracks: The diagnostic and therapy ones, and within them you can go either to an academic center or to a consulting company.</p>
>>>><p>How competitive is getting into a school?</p>
>>>>><p>I don't know about grad school, only applied to 1 place and got in. I know from other threads that the big names (Wisconsin, LSU, Kentucky, Vanderbilt...) are competitive. Residency is very competitive, like...VERY! haha</p>
>>>>>><p>What made you chose medical physics</p>
